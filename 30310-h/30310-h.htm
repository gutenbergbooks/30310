been moved to the ends of the sections. Inconsistencies in spelling (e.g.,
D'Arboval/D'Arborval) and hyphenation (e.g., postmortem/post-mortem) have

intent with a reasonable degree of certainty. The occasional error which
could not be resolved was marked [sic].The plate images are thumbnails.

id="ADMINISTRATION_OF_MEDICINES"></a>ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.</span></h3>

<p>Medicines may be administered to cattle in many ways. The channel and method
of administration depend on whether a general or local effect is desired, the
condition of the animal, and the nature of the medicine that is to be given.
The easiest method, and therefore the most common, is to give ordinary remedies
by the mouth with the food, with drink, or separately. There, are, however,
some conditions in which medicines administered in this way will not act
promptly enough, or wherein a desired effect of the medicine on a distant part
of the body is wholly lacking unless it is applied in some other way.</p>

<p>The various methods of administering medicines to cattle will be considered
below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the mouth</span>.&mdash;The simplest way to give
medicines by the mouth is to mix them with the food or water. This can be done
when the medicine is in the form of a powder or fluid, if but a small quantity
is to be given, if it does not have a taste that is disagreeable to the animal
and is not so irritant as to injure the lining membranes of the mouth and
throat.</p>

<p>The usual method of administering bulky or unpalatable doses is to mix them
with a fluid vehicle, such as water, milk, molasses, or broth, and give from a
bottle. A dose given in this way is known as a "drench." In administering a
drench the head of the animal should be elevated a little by an assistant. This
is best accomplished when standing on the left side of the cow's head and by
grasping the nose with the thumb and fingers of the right hand inserted in the
nostrils; with the left hand beneath the chin the head is further raised and
supported. If the animal is unruly, it may be tied in a stall or placed in a
stanchion. The medicine can now be poured into the mouth by inserting the neck
of the bottle between the lips on the right side. Care must be taken to avoid
getting the bottle between the back teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> The mouth of the bottle should be
inserted as far as the middle of the tongue and the contents poured slowly. If
the cow coughs, the head must at once be lowered to permit the fluid to escape
from the larynx. If medicine is given during coughing, some of the dose may
pass down the windpipe to the lungs and cause a severe or a fatal pneumonia.
This is especially to be guarded against when the throat is partly paralyzed or
insensitive, as in parturient paresis (milk fever). In this disease it has
often happened that drenches have been poured into the lungs, thus killing the
cow.</p>

<p>The quantity of fluid to be given in a drench depends upon the effect
desired and the nature of the medicine. In impactions of the stomach very large
quantities of fluid may be given&mdash;as much as a gallon or several gallons
at a time. Usually, however, it is not customary or desirable to give more than
from 1 to 2 quarts at a dose, and not more than a pint unless it is necessary
on account of the irritant quality of the drug that has to be shielded with a
large quantity of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Soluble medicines should be completely dissolved before they are given;
insoluble ones should be finely divided by powdering or by shaking, and should
be well agitated and mixed immediately before they are given. In the latter
case a menstruum with considerable body, such as molasses or flaxseed tea or
milk, will help to hold solids or oils in suspension until swallowed.</p>

<p><em>Balls</em> are large pills adapted for the larger animals. Powders or gums are
sometimes mixed with an adhesive substance and rolled into balls for the
purpose of convenience of administration. Balls are not used so much and are
not so well adapted to the medication of cattle as of horses. The process of
solution is slower in the paunch of a cow than in the stomach of a horse; if
the cow is so sick as to have stopped ruminating, a ball may get covered up and
lost in the mass of material in the paunch and so lie for days, producing no
effect whatever.</p>

<p><em>Capsules</em> are shells or envelopes made of soluble gelatin in which powders or
liquids may be inclosed. Capsules and balls are administered by being placed on
the tongue well back in the mouth while the tongue is drawn forward and the
mouth is held open by a block of wood between the back teeth. The ball should
be dropped, the tongue released, and the block removed as nearly simultaneously
as possible, so that the backward carriage of the tongue will throw the ball
into the throat and lead to its being swallowed. In introducing the ball care
must be taken to avoid having the hand cut or crushed. After a little
experience it is possible to do away with the block of wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the stomach</span>.&mdash;Medicines are introduced
directly into the first stomach by the use of an esophageal tube or through the
cannula of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
9]</a></span> trocar passed into the paunch through the side. This method is
used in the treatment of diseases of digestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the rectum</span>.&mdash;Medicines are usually
administered by the rectum for the purpose of controlling the bowels and for
the treatment of local diseases. Sometimes, however, medicines that have a
general effect are given in this way when, for any reason, it is not possible
or convenient to give them through the mouth. Only drugs that are readily
absorbed should be given per rectum for a general effect and in somewhat larger
dose or more frequently than when given by the mouth. Such stimulants as ether,
alcohol, or the aromatic spirits of ammonia, diluted with from four to six
times their bulk of warm water, may be used in this way.</p>

<p>Rectal injections, or enemata, are used in the treatment of constipation. If
it is the purpose of the injection to soften hardened fecal masses, the water
should be comfortably warm and may have a little clean soap in it. If it is the
purpose of the injection to stimulate sluggish bowels to contraction, the water
may be cold.</p>

<p>In giving rectal injections a rectal syringe may be used, or, better, a
piece of one-half to three-quarter inch rubber hose 5 feet long with a tin
funnel attached to one end. The hose is soaped or oiled and introduced slowly
and gently into the rectum 2 or 3 feet. The fluid is then slowly poured into
the funnel and allowed to gravitate into the rectum. The same apparatus may be
used for feeding by the rectum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the vagina</span>.&mdash;Medicines are inserted into
the vagina, and through the vagina into the womb, in a manner similar to that
of rectal administration. Most of the medication made use of in this way is for
the local treatment of these organs. Following calving, during outbreaks of
abortion, and in an infectious disease of the vagina, such injections become
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the udder</span>.&mdash;Injections into the udder are
now regularly made in the treatment of parturient paresis (milk fever). For
this purpose a 1 per cent solution of iodid of potassium is commonly employed,
although some other solutions and oxygen gas are also used. In making this
injection so many precautions are necessary in relation to the sterilization of
the apparatus and the teats and skin that this work should be left to a skilled
veterinarian. The introduction of even a minute quantity of infectious dirt may
cause the loss of the udder. For making this injection one may use one of the
prepared sets of apparatus or a milking tube and funnel connected by a piece of
small rubber hose. The apparatus should be boiled and kept wrapped in a clean
towel until needed. The udder and teats and the hands of the operator must be
well disinfected, and the solution must be freshly made with recently boiled
water kept in a sterile bottle. The udder should be emptied of milk before the
injection is made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span> After all these precautions have been observed the milking tube
may be inserted and through it one-half pint of solution introduced by gravity
air pressure or by syringe. There is practically no danger in this mode of
treatment if it is properly carried out.</p>

<p>Injections into the udder are sometimes made in the treatment of garget, but
so far with indifferent success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the nostrils</span>.&mdash;An animal may be caused to
inhale medicine in the form of gas or vapor or to snuff up a fine powder.
Sometimes, for the purpose of local treatment, fluids are injected into the
nose.</p>

<p>A medicine inhaled may have either a local or a general effect.</p>

<p>Medicated steam, carrying the volatile products of compound cresol solution,
carbolic acid, balsam of Peru, compound tincture of benzoin, tincture of iodin,
etc., may be liberated beneath the nostrils of a cow so that she must inhale
these soothing vapors; but such treatment is not so common for cattle as for
horses. In producing general anesthesia, or insensibility to pain, the vapor of
chloroform or ether is administered by the nostrils. As a preliminary to this
it is necessary to cast and confine the animal. Great care is necessary to
avoid complete stoppage of the heart or breathing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the trachea</span>.&mdash;Medicines are injected into
the trachea, or windpipe, in the treatment of some forms of diseases of the
lungs, and especially in that form of bronchitis or pneumonia that is caused by
lungworms. For this injection a large hypodermic syringe, fitted with a very
thick, strong needle, is used. The needle is to be inserted about the middle of
the neck and between the cartilaginous rings of the trachea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the skin</span>.&mdash;Although a number of drugs,
notably mercury, are so readily absorbed by the skin of cattle as to render
poisoning easy, medicines are not given in this way for their general or
constitutional but only for their local effect.</p>

<p>Diseases of the skin and superficial parasites are treated or destroyed by
applications in the forms of washes, ointments, dips, and powders. Liniments
and lotions are applied to the skin for the relief of some near-lying part,
such as a muscle, tendon, or joint. Blisters are applied to the skin for the
purpose of obtaining the effect of counterirritation upon a neighboring region
or organ. Cold water may be applied to the skin to reduce the temperature and
to diminish congestion or inflammation in a superficial area or to reduce the
temperature of the whole body. High fever and heat strokes are treated in this
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the tissue beneath the skin</span>.&mdash;Hypodermic
or subcutaneous injections are often made for the purpose of introducing a
drug, reagent, or vaccine directly into the connecting tissue beneath the skin.
Introduced in this way, the substance is quickly absorbed, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> none of it is
lost, and its whole effect is obtained, often within a few minutes.</p>

<p>There are numerous precautions necessary in making a subcutaneous injection,
most of which have to do with cleansing and sterilization. It is also important
to select a proper site for the injection, so that blood vessels, joints, and
superficial nerves, organs, or cavities may all be avoided. With due regard for
the necessary precautions, there is practically no danger in such an injection,
but it should be attempted only by those who are able to carry it through in a
surgically clean way. Only certain drugs can be given subcutaneously, and
dosage must be accurately graduated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By the veins</span>.&mdash;Certain medicines act most
promptly and surely when introduced directly into the blood by injecting them
into a vein, usually the jugular. Some vaccines and antitoxins are administered
in this way. Intravenous injection should be practiced only by experienced
veterinarians.</p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF FEEDS AND FEEDING.</h4>

<p>Diseases of the digestive organs are very common among cattle, and may often
be traced to defects in feeding. The first three stomachs of the larger
ruminants hold the feed for a long time, during which period it is subjected to
macerating, mixing, and straining processes in preparation for entrance into
the fourth or true stomach. The straining is accomplished through the medium of
the manyplies or book, while the paunch, or rumen, with its adjunct, the
waterbag, is concerned in the macerating, kneading, and mixing, as well as in
regurgitation for rumination or the chewing of the cud. The action of the first
three stomachs is merely preparatory to digestion. Thus it would seem that as a
result of their complex anatomical and functional arrangement the feed of the
ox, when of good quality and wholesome, is in the most favorable condition
possible for the digestive process when it reaches the fourth stomach, where
true digestion first takes place. The location and arrangement of the stomachs
are shown in <a href="#PLATE_I">Plates I</a> and <a href="#PLATE_II">II</a>.</p>

<p>If the feed is of improper character, or is so given that it can not be
cared for by the animal in a normal way, false fermentations arise, causing
indigestion, and possibly, later, organic disease. In feeding cattle there are
a number of important considerations apart from the economy of the ration, and
some of these are noted below.</p>

<p>Feeds must not be damaged by exposure to the weather, by frost, by molds, or
by deleterious fermentations.</p>

<p>Damaged feeds retard or prevent digestion, and sometimes they contain or
cause to be generated substances that irritate the digestive tract, or are
distinctly poisonous to the animal. For example, hay that was rained on
severely during curing has not only lost a part of its nutritive value through
a washing-out process, but what remains is not so readily available as in good
hay. Roots that have been frozen are likely to irritate and injure the
digestive tract. Grass eaten with frost on it may cause severe indigestion. All
moldy feeds are not injurious, for some molds appear to have no influence on
the process of digestion, but those of other species may not only retard
digestion and cause local injury to the digestive organs, but may cause general
poisoning of a severe and fatal type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> The
following molds have been shown (Dammann) to be dangerous in respect to the
production of the morbid conditions enumerated:</p>

<p><em>Tilletia caries</em> grows chiefly in wheat and may be found with the grain, thus
appearing in the bran or meal. It causes paralysis of the throat and spinal
cord and irritation of the digestive tract. The rusts, such as <em>Puccinia
graminis</em>, <em>P. straminis</em>, <em>P. Coronata</em>, and <em>P. arudinacea</em>, cause colic and
diarrhea, and in some cases partial paralysis of the throat. The rusts that
occur on clovers, beans, and peas cause very severe irritation of the lining
membrane of the mouth and throat, resulting sometimes in gangrene of this
tissue.</p>

<p><em>Polydesmus exitans</em> grows on the leaves of rape and turnips, appearing in
early summer. This fungus is very irritating to the mouths and feet of cattle,
causing severe inflammation and the formation of a false membrane. In some
instances this condition has been mistaken for foot-and-mouth disease, but it
can be differentiated by the absence of the blister that is characteristic of
that disease and by the further fact that it is nontransmissible.</p>

<p><em>Polytrincium trifolii</em>, which grows on clover, causing it to become black,
causes severe irritation of the stomach and intestines of cattle feeding upon
it.</p>

<p>Feeds must not contain too large a proportion of woody fiber or of
indigestible substances. If the dry matter ingested or the bulk of the feed is
very great on account of the small proportion of digestible matter, it is
impossible for the great mass to be moistened properly with and attacked by the
digestive juices. In consequence of this, abnormal fermentations arise, causing
indigestion and irritation of the digestive organs. On the other hand, a ration
too concentrated, and especially too rich in protein, is not suitable, because,
after a meal, the animal must have a certain feeling of fullness in order to be
comfortable and quiet, and the digestive organs require a relatively large
volume of contents to fill them to the point where secretion is properly
stimulated and their activity is most efficient. If too much protein is in the
ration there is a waste of expensive feed, and the tendency is for the animal
to become thin. It is evident that a cow can not thrive on concentrated feeds
alone, even though these contain in assimilable form all the nutritive
materials needed for perfect support. It is because bulk is necessary that the
standard of about 25 pounds of dry matter per cow per day has been reached by
experimenters. There is no objection to feeding grain or meal separately to a
cow, provided enough bulky feed is fed at another time in the day to keep the
digestive tract sufficiently distended.</p>

<p>In changing the ration, and especially in making radical changes, as at the
beginning and the end of the pasturing season, the change <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> should be
made gradually, so that the digestive organs may accommodate themselves to it.
After the digestive organs and juices have from long practice become adjusted
to the digestion of a certain feed, which is then suddenly withheld and another
of quite different character and properties is substituted, the second feed is
not well digested; it may even irritate the digestive canal. It is often
observed that cattle lose from 25 to 100 pounds when turned on pasture from dry
stable feed. This loss can readily be prevented by not shocking the digestive
organs by a sudden change of diet.</p>

<p>Regularity in feeding has much to do with the utilization of the ration, and
gross irregularity may cause indigestion and serious disease.</p>

<p>Water for live stock should be as free from contamination and as nearly pure
as that used for household purposes. When practicable it is well to warm the
water in the winter to about 50Â° F. and allow cattle to drink often.</p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE MOUTH.</h4>

<h5>WOUNDS AND CONTUSIONS OF THE LIPS, AND SNAKE BITE.</h5>

<p>The lips may become inflamed from contusions, which are sometimes produced
by a blow from the horns of another animal, or, in the case of working oxen, by
a blow from the driver. While cattle are grazing, more especially when they are
in woods, they may be bitten in the lips by insects or serpents.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;As a result of a contusion the lips become thick and
swollen, and if treatment is neglected the swelling may become hard and
indurated, or an abscess may form. This condition renders it difficult for the
animal to get food into its mouth, on account of the lips having lost their
natural flexibility. In such cases an ox will use his tongue more in the
prehension of food to make up for the incapacity of the lips. In cases of snake
bite the swelling is soft or puffy and its limits are not well defined.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When we have to deal with a bruise, the affected part
should be bathed with hot water two or three times daily. In recent cases no
other treatment will be required, but if the swelling is not recent and has
become hard or indurated, then the swollen part should be treated each day by
painting it with tincture of iodin. In snake bite a straight incision
penetrating into the flesh or muscle should be made across the center of the
swelling and in the direction of the long axis of the face. After this has been
done a small wad of cotton batting should be pressed against the wounds until
the bleeding has almost stopped. Afterwards the following lotion may be applied
to the wounds several times a day: Permanganate of potassium, half a dram;
distilled water, 1 pint. As snake bites are usually <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> attended with considerable
depression, which may terminate in stupor, it is advisable to give a stimulant.
One ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia mixed with a pint of water should be
given, and the dose should be repeated in half an hour if the animal is sinking
into a stupefied and unconscious condition. The repetition of the dose must
depend on the symptoms which the animal shows. It must be borne in mind that
the object of treatment is to ward off the stupor, which is one of the results
of snake bite. The swelling from an insect bite should be bathed with ammonia
water as soon as noticed and then treated with frequent applications of hot
water.</p>

<h5>SALIVATION.</h5>

<p>Salivation is a symptom of some general or local disorder. It may be a
symptom of a general disease, such as rabies or foot-and-mouth disease, or it
may be a purely local trouble, as when copious secretion of the salivary glands
is produced by the eating of irritating plants, such as wild mustard. When
saliva is observed to dribble from the mouth, that part should be carefully
examined by introducing into the mouth an instrument like a balling iron, or,
if one is not at hand, by grasping the tongue and partially withdrawing it from
the mouth, and by placing a block of wood between the back teeth, while all
parts of the mouth are exposed to a good light, so that the presence of any
foreign substance may be detected. The cause is sometimes found to be a short
piece of wood becoming fixed on the palate, its two ends resting on the upper
molar teeth of each side; or it may be a needle, thorn, or splinter of wood
embedded in the tongue. Sometimes a sharp piece of tin or other metal may
become partially embedded in the inner surface of the cheek. Hay occasionally
possesses some quality, usually dependent upon its having heated in the mow or
having become moldy, which produces salivation. Second-crop clover and some
irritant weeds in the pasture or forage may cause salivation. Cattle rubbed
with mercurial ointment may swallow enough mercury in licking themselves to
bring about the same result. (See "Mercury poisoning," <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>.) Such cases, of
course, arise from the constitutional action of mercury, and, on account of the
common habit which the animals have of licking themselves, indicate the danger
of using such preparation externally. Mercury is also readily absorbed through
the skin, and as cattle are very susceptible to its action it is thus easy for
them to be poisoned by it even without licking it from the surface. Cases of
mercurial poisoning sometimes follow disinfection of cattle stables with the
usual 1 to 1,000 solution of mercuric chlorid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If salivation depends on the irritation and inflammation set
up by the ingestion of acrid plants, or forage possessing some peculiar
stimulating property, the feed must be changed, and a lotion composed of an
ounce of powdered alum dissolved in a quart of water may be syringed into the
mouth twice a day, using half a pint of the solution each time. If, however,
the salivation is due to the presence of a thorn, splinter of wood, or any
other foreign substance embedded in the cheek or tongue, the offending object
should be removed and the mouth washed occasionally with a weak solution (2 per
cent) of carbolic acid and tepid water. When salivation is produced by
mercurial poisoning or by foot-and-mouth disease, the treatment appropriate to
those general conditions of the system, as well as the local treatment should
be applied. (For information about foot-and-mouth disease see <a href="#Page_383">p. 383</a>.)</p>

<h5>IRREGULARITIES OF THE TEETH.</h5>

<p>Irregularities of the teeth may be occasioned by the unequal wearing of some
of the teeth or by some of the incisors being broken, which may happen when
cattle are pastured on sandy or gravelly soil. The molar teeth may also show
irregular wear from similar causes, or from a disease or malformation of the
jaw. Their edges may become sharp, or it may happen that a molar tooth has been
accidentally fractured. It may also occur that a supernumerary tooth has
developed in an unusual position, and that it interferes with the natural and
regular mastication of the feed.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The mouth may be examined by grasping the animal's tongue
with one hand and partially withdrawing it from the mouth, so as to expose the
incisor and molar teeth to inspection. When it is desired, however, to examine
the molar teeth with the fingers, so as to obtain a better idea of their
condition, an instrument like the balling iron which is used for the horse
should be introduced into the mouth, so as to separate the jaws and keep them
apart while the examination is being made. Any sharp edges of the molars must
be removed by the tooth rasp, such as is used for horses. Any supernumerary
tooth which interferes with mastication or any tooth which is fractured or
loose should be extracted. In performing such operations it is desirable to
throw, or cast, the animal, and to have its head held securely, so as to enable
the operator to do what is necessary without difficulty.</p>

<h5>CARIES OR DECAY OF THE TEETH.</h5>

<p>The presence of caries may be suspected if the mouth exhales a bad odor and
if the animal during mastication occasionally stops as if it were in pain. The
existence of caries in a molar tooth may be ascertained by examining the mouth
in the manner already described. If <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>one of the molars is found to be carious, it
should be extracted. When the crown of the tooth has been destroyed and only
the stump or root is left, extraction is impracticable. In case the animal has
special value the root stumps may be removed by a veterinarian by the operation
of trephining; otherwise, it is best to sell the animal to the butcher.</p>

<h5>ACTINOMYCOSIS OF THE JAWBONES (BIG JAW OR LUMPY JAW).</h5>

<h5>[See Actinomycosis, <a href="#Page_440">p. 440</a>.]</h5>

<h5>INFLAMMATION OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF MOUTH (STOMATITIS).</h5>

<p>The membrane of the mouth may become inflamed by eating some irritating
substance or plant, or little vesicles may form in the mouths of calves when
they are affected with indigestion, constituting what is termed aphtha.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The saliva dribbles from the mouth, and when the mouth is
examined the surface of the tongue and other parts appear red and inflamed.
When young animals are affected with the form of disease termed aphtha, small
red elevations are observed on the tongue and other parts of the mouth, having
little white points on their centers, which consist of the epithelium of the
mucous membrane raised into vesicles. These white patches are succeeded by
ulcerated surfaces, which are caused by the shedding of the white patches of
epithelium.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When there is merely a reddened and inflamed condition of
the mucous membrane of the mouth, it will suffice to syringe it out several
times a day with 4 ounces of the following solution: Alum, 1 ounce; water, 2
pints. When the edges of the tongue and other parts of the mouth are studded
with ulcers, they should be painted over once a day with the following solution
until the affected surface is healed: Permanganate of potassium, 20 grains;
water, 1 ounce. When indigestion is associated with an ulcerated condition of
the mouth, separate treatment is required.</p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE PHARYNX AND GULLET.</h4>

<h5>PHARYNGITIS (SORE THROAT).</h5>

<p>Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the pharynx. It
is frequently associated with inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract,
such as laryngitis and bronchitis or pleurisy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The muzzle is dry and the saliva dribbles from the corners of
the mouth; the animal swallows with difficulty or not at all, and holds its
neck in a stiff, straight position, moving it as little as possible. The
eyelids are half closed, the white of the eye is bloodshot, and the animal
occasionally grinds its teeth. After masticating the feed the animal drops it
out of its mouth as if to avoid the pain of swallowing, and also evinces pain
when pressure is applied externally on the pharynx and tries to prevent the
pressure from being applied.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Pharyngitis may be produced by a sudden cooling of the surface
of the body, as when cattle are exposed to a cold wind or a cold rain; or by
swallowing irritant substances.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The throat should be syringed three times a day with an
ounce of the following solution: Nitrate of silver, 1&frac12; drams; distilled
water, 1 pint. Bland and soothing drinks, such as linseed tea or oatmeal and
water should occasionally be offered. Diet should consist of soft food, such as
bran mashes with a little linseed meal mixed in them. Dry hay and fodder should
not be given. Fresh, green grass or sound ensilage may be fed in small
quantities. The upper part of the throat and the space between the jaws should
be well rubbed once a day with the following liniment: Liquor ammonia fortior,
4 ounces; oil of turpentine, 4 ounces; olive oil, 4 ounces; mix. When evidence
of blistering appears the application of the liniment should be stopped and the
skin anointed with vaseline. Under the treatment described above the
inflammation of the throat will gradually subside and the animal will be able
to swallow as usual in five or six days. We need hardly say that during its
treatment the sick animal should be kept in a comfortable stable.</p>

<h5>PAROTITIS.</h5>

<p>Inflammation of the parotid gland may arise from the inflammation extending
to it when an ox is affected with pharyngitis or laryngitis, or the
inflammation may commence in the salivary ducts and may depend on some
influence the nature of which is unknown. Parotitis sometimes arises from a
blow or contusion severe enough to set up inflammation in the structure of the
gland. Tuberculosis and actinomycosis may infrequently be characterized by the
lodgment of their parasitic causes in the parotid glands, in which case
parotitis may be a symptom of either of these diseases.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;There is an elongated, painful swelling, beginning at the
base of the ear and passing downward along the posterior margin of the lower
jaw. The swelling is sometimes limited to one side, and when both are swollen
it is generally larger on one side than on the other. The secretion of saliva
is increased, the appetite is poor, the neck is stiff, so that it is painful to
raise the head, and feed is swallowed with difficulty. In many cases the
swelling of the glands, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>when submitted to proper treatment, disappears
in a comparatively short time. In other cases, however, they remain enlarged,
even after the animal recovers its appetite. In tuberculosis, lymphatic glands
beneath the parotid glands are sometimes enlarged, thus causing the appearance
of enlarged parotid glands.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A warm bran poltice, made by mixing bran with a hot 2 per
cent compound cresol solution in water, should be applied on the swollen gland
and kept in place by means of a bandage. Whenever the poultice has cooled it
should be replaced by a new one. This treatment should be continued until the
pain is less and the swelling is reduced or until there is evidence of pus
formation, which may be ascertained by examining the surface of the gland with
the fingers; and when, on pressing any part of the surface, it is found to
fluctuate or "give," then we may conclude that there is a collection of pus at
that place. It is well not to open the abscess until the fluctuation is well
marked, as at this stage the pus or matter is near the surface and there is
less trouble in healing the wound than if the pus is deep seated. The abscess
should be opened with a clean, sharp knife. The poulticing should then be
continued for two or three days, but the form of the poultice should be
changed, by replacing the bran with absorbent cotton and pouring the compound
cresol solution on the cotton. At all times the wound should be kept clean and
the cavity injected once or twice daily with a solution of 1 dram of carbolic
acid in 8 ounces of water. Under this treatment the pus may cease and the wound
heal without complications. Saliva may issue from the orifice and result in the
formation of a salivary fistula. This requires operative treatment by a
qualified veterinarian. When poulticing fails to reduce the swelling or produce
softening, the inflamed area may be rubbed once daily with camphorated oil,
compound iodin ointment, or painted twice daily with Lugol's solution of iodin.
The diet should be as recommended under Pharyngitis (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>).</p>

<h5>PHARYNGEAL POLYPI.</h5>

<p>Tumors form not infrequently in the pharynx, and may give rise to a train of
symptoms varying according to their size and location. The tumor may be so
situated that by shifting its position a little it may partially obstruct the
posterior nares (nostrils), when, of course, it will render nasal breathing
very noisy and labored. In another situation its partial displacement may
impede the entrance of air into the larynx. In almost any part of the pharynx,
but especially near the entrance of the gullet, tumors interfere with the act
of swallowing. As they are frequently attached to the wall of the pharynx by a
pedicel or stalk, it will be seen that they may readily be displaced in
different directions so as to produce the symptoms <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>before described. Enlarged
postpharyngeal lymphatic glands are not rare in tuberculosis, and by pressing
upon the wall of the pharynx and restricting the lumen of this organ they cause
difficulty in both breathing and swallowing. Such enlarged glands may be
differentiated from tumors by passing the hand into the cow's throat after the
jaws are separated by a suitable speculum or gag.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The method of treatment in such cases is to separate the
animal's jaws with an instrument termed a gag, and then, after drawing the
tongue partially forward, to pass the hand into the pharynx and to twist the
tumor gently from its attachment. One veterinarian who has had considerable
practice in treating this form of disease scrapes through the attachment of the
tumor gradually with his thumb nail. When the attachment is too strong to be
severed in this way an instrument like a thimble, but possessing a sharp edge
at the end, may be used to effect the same purpose, or the base of the tumor
may be severed by the use of a crushing instrument known as an Ã©craseur.</p>

<h5>CHOKING.</h5>

<p>Choking usually happens from attempting to swallow too large an object, such
as a turnip, potato, beet, apple, or pear, though in rare cases it may occur
from bran, chaff, or some other finely divided feed lodging in and filling up a
portion of the gullet. This latter form of the accident is most likely to occur
in animals that are greedy feeders.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms vary somewhat according to the part of the
gullet or throat in which the obstruction is. In most cases there is a
discharge of saliva from the mouth; the animal coughs frequently, and when it
drinks the water is soon ejected. The cow stops eating and stands back from the
trough, the expression is troubled, breathing is accelerated, and oftentimes
there is bloating as a result of the retention of gas in the paunch. These
symptoms, however, are not always present, for if the obstacle does not
completely close the throat or gullet, gas and water may pass, thus
ameliorating the discomfort. If the obstruction is in the neck portion of the
gullet, it may be felt as a lump in the left jugular gutter.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If the object is in the throat, it is advisable to put a
gag in the animal's mouth, and, while the head is held in a horizontal
direction by two assistants, to pass the hand into the pharynx, grasp the
foreign body, and withdraw it gradually and steadily. When the substance is
lodged in the upper part of the gullet, pressure should be made by an assistant
in an upward direction against the object while the operator passes his hand
into the pharynx, and if the assistant can not by pressure dislodge the
substance from the gullet, the operator may by passing his middle finger above
and partly behind <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
21]</a></span>the substance gradually slide it into the pharynx and then
withdraw it by the mouth.</p>

<p>The presence of an obstructing substance in the cervical (neck) portion of
the gullet may be ascertained by passing the hand along the left side of the
neck, when a hard and painless swelling will be found to indicate the presence
of the foreign body. In such cases we must endeavor by gentle and persevering
pressure with the thumb and next two fingers to slide the obstructing substance
gradually upward to the pharynx. To facilitate this it is well to give the
animal a half pint of raw linseed or olive oil before the manipulations
described are commenced. When the substance has been brought into or nearly
into the pharynx, then the mouth gag should be used, the tongue drawn partially
forward with the left hand, and the right should be passed backward into the
pharynx to withdraw the obstruction.</p>

<p>When bran or chaff causes the trouble it is best to give a small quantity of
oil to lubricate the walls of the gullet, and then by gentle and persevering
pressure, to endeavor to separate and divide the mass and to work it downward
toward the stomach. This will be assisted by pouring small quantities of oil
and water down the animal's throat. It is not advisable to use the probang to
push down any soft material, such as oats or chaff, as this generally condenses
and renders firmer the obstructing substance by pressing its particles or
elements together, so that it forms a solid, resisting mass which can not be
moved.</p>

<p>In some cases the foreign body, either because it is in the chest portion of
the esophagus, and so beyond reach, or because too firmly seated, can not be
dislodged from the neck by pressing and manipulating that part externally. In
such event we must resort to the use of the probang. (<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl.
III</a>, figs. 2 and 3.) A probang is a flexible instrument and adapts itself
to the natural curvature of the gullet, and if used cautiously there is not
much risk of injury. Before passing the probang, a gag which has an aperture at
each end, from which straps pass to be buckled at the back of the head below
the horns, is introduced into the mouth. (<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl. III</a>, fig.
4.) The probang should then be oiled, and, the head and neck being held in
a straight line by two assistants, the tongue must be partly drawn out of the
mouth, the probang cautiously passed along the roof of the mouth into the
pharynx and thence into the gullet, through which it is passed down. If
resistance is met, gentle and continuous pressure must be used, under the
influence of which the object will generally in a short time pass into the
stomach. One must be careful not to pass the probang into the larynx and thence
into the windpipe, as an animal may readily be killed in this way. This
accident is indicated by efforts to cough and by violently disturbed breathing.
If such symptoms arise the probang must be withdrawn at once. To <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> avoid a wrong
passage, the end of the tube should be pressed very slowly through the throat
until its presence in the esophagus is assured. After it is once in the
esophagus care is still necessary, because the walls of this tube may easily be
torn.</p>

<p>Some writers have advised that when the obstruction is lodged in the
cervical (neck) portion of the gullet it should be struck with a mallet, to
crush it and thus alter its shape, so that it may easily slip down into the
stomach. If the obstructing substance is hard, this will be a dangerous
operation, but if soft&mdash;as in the case of a ripe pear, for
example&mdash;this procedure may be safely adopted.</p>

<p>In all cases, if pressure applied on the neck fails to move the obstruction
and the probang also fails to move it, it may be divided by a subcutaneous
operation, or the gullet may be opened and the obstructing substance removed
through the wound. In such cases the assistance of a veterinarian or a surgeon
must be obtained.</p>

<h5>WOUNDS AND INJURIES OF THE GULLET.</h5>

<p>Sometimes the walls of the gullet may be more or less lacerated or abraded
by the rash and too forcible use of the probang, and the animal consequently
swallows with pain and difficulty. In such cases dry feed must be withheld for
five or six days, so as to allow the injured parts to heal, and the diet must
be limited to linseed tea, hay tea, and thin oatmeal gruel and molasses. The
same kind of diet must be fed after the operation of cutting into the gullet
has been performed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the gullet is ruptured and lacerated to such an extent that
treatment of any kind is hopeless. This has been known to occur when the handle
of a pitchfork or buggy whip has been pushed down a cow's throat to remove an
obstruction. When such treatment has been applied it is best to slaughter the
animal without delay, as the flesh may be utilized so long as there is no fever
or general disease, and remedial treatment would be hopeless. In this
connection it may be mentioned that whatever substitute may be used for a
probang, which sometimes is not at hand, it should be flexible and should
possess a smooth surface. A piece of new rope, with the end closely wrapped and
waxed and then oiled, or a piece of thin garden hose, or a well-wrapped twisted
wire may be used in emergencies.</p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE STOMACHS.</h4>

<h5>ACUTE TYMPANITES (HOVEN, OR BLOATING).</h5>

<p>Tympanites is a distention of the rumen or paunch with gases of
fermentation, and is manifested outwardly by swelling in the region of the left
flank.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Tympanites may be caused by any kind of feed which produces
indigestion. When cattle are first turned into young clover <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>they eat so
greedily of it that tympanites frequently results. Turnips, potatoes, cabbage,
or the discarded pulp from sugar-beet factories may also cause it. Middlings
and corn meal also frequently give rise to it.</p>

<p>Care is necessary in turning animals into fields of clover or stubble fields
in which there is a strong growth of volunteer grain. It is always better to
keep them from such pasturage while it is wet with dew, and they should be
taken out when they have eaten a moderate quantity. When cattle are fed upon
pulp from sugar beets, germinated malt, etc., they should be fed in moderate
amounts until they have become accustomed to it, as any of these feeds may give
rise to severe bloating.</p>

<p>An excessive quantity of any of the before-mentioned feeds may bring on this
disorder, or it may not be caused by excess, but to eating too hastily.
Sometimes the quality of the feed is at fault. Grass or clover when wet by dew
or rain frequently disorders digestion and brings on tympanites; frozen roots
or pastures covered with hoar frost should also be regarded as dangerous. When
feed has been eaten too hastily, or when it is cold and wet, the digestive
process is imperfectly performed, and the feed contained in the paunch
ferments, during which process large quantities of gas are formed. The same
result may follow when a cow is choked, as the obstruction in the gullet
prevents the eructation or passing up of gas from the stomach, so that the gas
continues to accumulate until tympanites results.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The swelling of the left flank is very characteristic, as in
well-marked cases the flank at its upper part rises above the level of the
backbone, and when struck with the tips of the fingers emits a drum-like sound.
The animal has an anxious expression, moves uneasily, and is evidently
distressed. If relief is not obtained in time, it breathes with difficulty,
reels in walking or in standing, and in a short time falls and dies from
suffocation. The distention of the stomach may become so great as to prevent
the animal from breathing, and in some instances the case may be complicated by
rupture of the stomach.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If the case is not extreme, it may be sufficient to drive
the animal at a walk for a quarter or half an hour; or cold water by the
bucketful may be thrown against the cow's sides. In some cases the following
simple treatment is successful: A rope or a twisted straw band is coated with
pine tar, wagon grease, or other unsavory substance and is placed in the cow's
mouth as a bit, being secured by tying behind the horns. The efforts of the
animal to dislodge this object result in movements of the tongue, jaws, and
throat that stimulate the secretion of saliva and swallowing, thus opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>the
esophagus, which permits the exit of gas and at the same time peristalsis is
stimulated reflexly.</p>

<p>In urgent cases the gas must be allowed to escape without delay, and this is
best accomplished by the use of the trocar. The trocar is a sharp-pointed
instrument incased in a cannula or sheath, which leaves the sharp point of the
trocar free. (See <a href="#PLATE_III">Pl. III</a>, figs. <em>5a</em> and <em>5b</em>.)
In selecting the point for using the trocar a spot on the left side equally
distant from the last rib, the hip bone, and the transverse processes of the
lumbar vertebrÃ¦ must be chosen. Here an incision about three-fourths of an inch
long should be made with a knife through the skin, and then the sharp point of
the trocar, being directed downward, inward, and slightly forward, is thrust
into the paunch. (<a href="#PLATE_I">Pl. I</a>.) The cannula or sheath of the
trocar should be left in the paunch so long as any gas continues to issue from
it. If the cannula is removed while gas is still forming in the paunch and the
left flank becomes considerably swollen, it may be necessary to insert it
again. It is well, accordingly, to observe the cannula closely, and if gas is
found to be issuing from it it should not be removed. When gas issues from it
in c onsiderable quantities the sound accompanying its escape renders the exact
condition obvious. It is occasionally necessary to keep the cannula in the
stomach for several hours. When this is necessary a piece of stout cord should
be passed round the neck of the cannula immediately below the projecting rim
and then be passed round the animal's body and tied in a secure knot, and a
careful attendant must remain with the cow during the entire period that the
instrument is in place. The rim surrounding the mouth of the cannula should be
in contact with the skin. Whenever the person in charge of the cow is convinced
that gas has ceased to issue from the cannula the instrument should be
removed.</p>

<p>The trocar is to be used only in extreme or urgent cases, though everyone
who has had experience in treating indigestion in cattle realizes that he has
saved the lives of many animals by its prompt application.</p>

<p>When the tympanitic animal is not distressed and the swelling of the flank
is not great, or when the most distressing condition has been removed by the
use of the trocar, it is best to use internal medicine. Two ounces of aromatic
spirits of ammonia should be given every half hour in a quart of cold water; or
half an ounce of chlorid of lime may be dissolved in a pint of tepid water and
the dose repeated every half hour until the bloating has subsided; or 1 ounce
of creolin in 2 quarts of tepid water may be given at one dose or carefully
injected through the cannula directly into the paunch to stop fermentation and
the consequent formation of gas. It is generally necessary to give a moderate
dose of purgative medi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
25]</a></span>cine after bloating has subsided, as animals frequently show
symptoms of constipation after attacks of indigestion. For this purpose 1 pound
of Glauber's salt may be used.</p>

<p>The animal should be fed carefully upon easily digested food for several
days after the bloating has subsided, so that all fermenting matter may pass
out of the stomach.</p>

<h5>CHRONIC TYMPANITES.</h5>

<p>Cattle, especially those that have been kept in the stable all winter, are
liable to suffer from chronic tympanites. In this form they bloat up after
feeding, but seldom swell so much as to cause any alarm. The chronic form of
indigestion may also follow an acute attack like that previously described.
This is also a symptom of tuberculosis when the lymphatic glands lying between
the lungs are so enlarged as to press upon and partly occlude the esophagus. It
may develop in calves as a result of the formation of hair balls in the
stomach.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment should be preceded by a moderate dose of
purgative medicine: 1 pound of sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salt) or sulphate of
soda (Glauber's salt), half an ounce of powdered Barbados aloes, 1 ounce of
powdered ginger, 1 pint of molasses. The salts and aloes should be dissolved by
stirring for a few minutes in 2 quarts of lukewarm water, then the molasses
should be added, and after all the ingredients have been stirred together for
about 10 minutes the dose should be administered. After the operation of the
purgative it is generally necessary to give some tonic and antacid preparation
to promote digestion, which is imperfectly performed in such cases. The
following may be used: Powdered gentian, 3 ounces; powdered bicarbonate of
potash, 3 ounces; powdered ginger, 3 ounces; powdered capsicum, 1 ounce. Mix
and divide into 12 powders, one of which should be given three times a day
before feeding, shaken up with a pint and a half of water. It is also
advantageous in such cases to give two heaped teaspoonsfuls of wood charcoal,
mixed with the animal's feed three times a day. The animal should also go out
during the day, as want of exercise favors the continuance of this form of
indigestion. If the dung is hard, the constipation should be overcome by
feeding a little flaxseed twice daily or by giving a handful of Glauber's salt
in the feed once or twice daily, as may be necessary. Roots, silage, and other
succulent feeds are useful in this connection. If tuberculosis is suspected as
the cause of chronic bloating, a skilled veterinarian should make a diagnosis,
using the tuberculin test if necessary. Until it is settled that the cow has
not tuberculosis, she should be kept apart from the other members of the herd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h5>DISTENTION OF RUMEN OR PAUNCH WITH FEED.</h5>

<p>This form of indigestion is caused by the animal gorging itself with feed,
and arises more from the animal's voracious appetite than from any defect in
the quality of the feed supplied to it. The condition is, however, more severe
if the feed consumed is especially concentrated or difficult of digestion. In
cases of this kind there is comparatively no great formation of gas, and the
gas which is formed is diffused through the stomach instead of accumulating in
a layer in its upper part. On pressing the flank with the closed fist the
indent of the hand remains for a short time in the flank, as if the rumen were
filled with a soft, doughy mass.</p>

<p>This form of indigestion should be treated by stimulants, such as aromatic
spirits of ammonia.</p>

<p>If the formation of gas is not great and the distention with solid material
is somewhat limited, the animal may be drenched through a piece of ordinary
garden hose, one end inserted in the mouth, and the other end fitted with a
funnel, giving 1&frac12; pounds of Epsom salt or Glauber's salt dissolved in 2
gallons of water, at a single dose. Immediately after this treatment the left
side of the animal, extending below the median line of the abdomen, should be
powerfully kneaded with the fist, so that the impacted food mass will be
broken, allowing the water to separate it into small portions which can be
carried downward for the process of digestion. But if the treatment fails and
the impacted or overloaded condition of the rumen continues, it may become
necessary to make an incision with a sharp, long-bladed knife in the left
flank, commencing at the point where it is usual to puncture the stomach of an
ox, and prolong the incision in a downward direction until it is long enough to
admit the hand. When the point of the knife is thrust into the flank and the
blade cuts downward, the wall of the stomach, the muscle, and the skin should
all be cut through at the same time. Two assistants should hold the edges of
the wound together so as to prevent any food from slipping between the flank
and the wall of the stomach, and then the operator should remove two-third [sic] of
the contents of the rumen. This having been done, the edges of the wound should
be sponged with a little carbolized warm water, and, the lips of the wound in
the rumen being turned inward, they should be brought together with catgut
stitches. The wound penetrating the muscle and the skin may then be brought
together by silk stitches, which should pass through the entire thickness of
the muscle and should be about 1 inch apart. The wound should afterwards be
dressed once a day with a lotion and the animal covered with a tight linen
sheet, to protect the wound from insects and dirt. The lotion to be used in
such case is made up as follows: Sulphate of zinc, 1 dram; carbolic acid, 2
drams; glycerin, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
27]</a></span>2 ounces; water, 14 ounces; mix. It is clear that this operation
requires special skill and it should be attempted only by those who are
competent.</p>

<h5>IMAGINARY DISEASES (HOLLOW HORN; LOSS OF CUD; WOLF IN THE TAIL).</h5>

<p>It would appear quite in place here, in connection with the diseases of the
stomach and bowels of cattle, to consider the three old fallacies or
superstitions known by the above names, since these names, whenever and
wherever used, seem to be invariably applied to some form of digestive
derangement or disease having its origin in the stomach and bowels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollow horn</span>.&mdash;In the first place it should
be noted that the horns of all animals of the ox tribe are hollow. The horn
cores are elongations of the frontal bones of the skull, and the frontal
sinuses, which are the larger of the air spaces of the head, are prolonged into
the horn cores. When a cow is sick, if the horns are hot it is an evidence of
fever; if they are cold it indicates impaired circulation of the blood; but
these manifestations of sickness are to be regarded as symptoms of some
constitutional disorder and do not in themselves require treatment. The
treatment should be applied to the disease which causes the abnormal
temperature of the horns. The usual treatment for the supposed hollow horn,
which consists in boring the horns with a gimlet and pouring turpentine into
the openings thus made, is not only useless and cruel, but is liable to set up
an acute inflammation and result in an abscess of the sinus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loss of cud</span>.&mdash;The so-called loss of cud is
simply a cessation of rumination, frequently one of the first indications of
some form of disease, since ruminants stop chewing the cud when they feel sick.
Loss of cud is a symptom of a great many diseases, and when it is detected it
should lead the observer to try to discover other symptoms upon which to base a
correct opinion as to the nature of the disease from which the animal suffers.
No local treatment is required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolf in the tail</span>.&mdash;This term also seems to
be vaguely applied to various disturbances of the digestive function, or to
some disease which is in reality in the stomach or bowels.</p>

<h5>VOMITING.</h5>

<p>Vomiting is not to be confounded with rumination, though some writers have
advanced the opinion that it is merely a disordered and irregular rumination.
It is not of common occurrence in cattle.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Animals which vomit are frequently in poor condition. After
having eaten tranquilly for some time the animal suddenly becomes uneasy,
arches the back, stretches the neck and head, and then suddenly ejects 10 to 12
pounds of the contents of the rumen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> After having done this the uneasiness subsides
and in a short time the animal resumes eating as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;The cause of this disordered state of the digestive system in
cattle is usually obscure, but has in some cases been traced to a partial
closure of the opening into the second stomach or to a distention of the
esophagus. It has been found to occur when there was cancerous disease of the
fourth stomach, and experimentally it has been shown that a suspension of
digestion or great derangement of this stomach produces considerable nervous
disorder of the rumen and sometimes vomiting or attempts to vomit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment</span>.&mdash;Easily digested feed and plenty
of water should be given. Fear and excitement, chasing, or hurrying animals
after they have eaten heartily are liable to bring on this result. In order to
overcome irritation which may produce vomiting the following draft should be
given: Hydrate of chloral, half an ounce; water, 1 pint. The dose must be
repeated when the condition of the animal seems to require it. As a rule,
treatment is not successful.</p>

<h5>DEPRAVED APPETITE (PICA).</h5>

<p>Cattle suffering from this disease have a capricious and variable appetite
as regards their ordinary feed but evince a strong desire to lick and eat
substances for which healthy cattle show no inclination. Alkaline and
saline-tasting substances are especially attractive to cattle having a depraved
appetite and they frequently lick lime, earth, coal, gravel, and even the dung
of other cattle. Cows in calf and young cattle are especially liable to develop
these symptoms. Animals affected in this way lose condition, their coat is
staring, gait slow, and small vesicles containing yellow liquid form under the
tongue; the milk given by such cows is thin and watery. Such animals become
restless and uneasy, as is indicated by frequent bellowing. The disease may
last for months, the animal ultimately dying emaciated and exhausted. Depraved
appetite frequently precedes the condition in which the bones of cattle become
brittle and fracture easily, which is known as osteomalacia.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;From the fact that this disease is largely one of regions, it
is generally believed that some condition of the soil and water and of the
local vegetation is responsible for it. It is more prevalent some years than
others, and is most common in old countries, where the soil is more or less
depleted. Cattle pastured on low, swampy land become predisposed to it. It
occasionally happens, however, that one individual in a herd suffers though all
are fed alike; in such cases the disease must arise from the affected animal's
imperfect assimilation of the nutritive elements of the feed which is supplied
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The aim in such cases must be to improve the process of
digestion and to supply the animal with a sufficiency of sound and wholesome
feed. The following should be given to the cow three times a day, a heaping
tablespoonful constituting a dose: Carbonate of iron, 4 ounces; finely ground
bone or "bone flour," 1 pound; powdered gentian, 4 ounces; common salt, 8
ounces; powdered fenugreek, 4 ounces; mix. In addition to this, 3
tablespoonfuls of powdered charcoal may be mixed with the feed three times a
day, and a piece of rock salt should be placed where the animal can lick it at
will. German veterinarians have had brilliant results from the treatment of
this disease with subcutaneous injections of apomorphin in doses of 1&frac12; to 5
grains for three or four days.</p>

<h5>HAIR CONCRETIONS.</h5>

<p>Hair concretions, or hair balls, result from the habit which some cattle
have of licking themselves or other animals. As a result the hairs which are
swallowed are carried around by the contractions of the stomach and gradually
assume the form of a small pellet or ball. This increases in size as fresh
quantities of hair are introduced into the stomach and adhere to the surface of
the ball. These balls are found most frequently in the reticulum or second
stomach (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl. II</a>, B), though sometimes in the rumen. In
calves hair balls are generally found in the fourth stomach. There are no
certain symptoms by which we can determine the presence of hair balls in the
stomach, and therefore no treatment can be recommended for such cases. In
making post-mortem examinations of cattle we have sometimes found the walls of
the reticulum transfixed with nails or pieces of wire, and yet the animal had
not shown any symptoms of indigestion, but had died from maladies not involving
the second stomach.</p>

<h5>INDIGESTION (DYSPEPSIA, OR GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH).</h5>

<p>Tympanites, already described, is a form of indigestion in which the chief
symptom and most threatening condition is the collection of gas in the paunch.
This symptom does not always accompany indigestion, so it is well here to
consider other forms under a separate head. If indigestion is long continued,
the irritant abnormal products developed cause catarrh of the stomach and
intestines&mdash;gastrointestinal catarrh. On the other hand, however, irritant
substances ingested may cause gastrointestinal catarrh, which, in turn, will
cause indigestion; hence, it results that these several conditions are usually
found existing together.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>s.&mdash;Irritant feed, damaged feed, overloading of the stomach, or
sudden changes of diet may cause this disease. Want of exercise
predisposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
30]</a></span> to it, or feed which is coarse and indigestible may after a time
produce it. Feed which possesses astringent properties and tends to check
secretion may also act as an exciting cause. Feed in excessive quantity may
lead to disorder of digestion and to this disease. It is very likely to appear
toward the end of protracted seasons of drought; therefore a deficiency of
water must be regarded as one of the conditions which favor its development.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Diminished appetite, rumination irregular, tongue coated,
mouth slimy, dung passed apparently not well digested and smelling bad,
dullness, and fullness of the flanks. The disease may in some cases assume a
chronic character, and in addition to the foregoing symptoms slight bloating or
tympanites of the left flank may be observed; the animal breathes with effort
and each respiration may be accompanied with a grunt, the ears and horns are
alternately hot and cold, rumination ceases, the usual rumbling sound in the
stomach is not audible, the passage of dung is almost entirely suspended, and
the animal passes only a little mucus occasionally. Sometimes there is
alternating constipation and diarrhea. There is low fever in many cases.</p>

<p>The disease continues a few days or a week in the mild cases, while the
severe cases may last several weeks. In the latter form the emaciation and loss
of strength may be very great. There is no appetite, no rumination, nor
peristalsis. The mouth is hot and sticky, the eyes have receded in their
sockets, and milk secretion has ceased. In such cases the outlook for recovery
is unfavorable. The patient falls away in flesh and becomes weaker, as is shown
by the fact that one frequently finds it lying down.</p>

<p>On examining animals which have died of this disease it is found that the
lining membrane of the fourth stomach and the intestines, particularly the
small intestine, is red, swollen, streaked with deeper red or bluish lines, or
spotted. The lining of the first three stomachs is more or less softened, and
may easily be peeled off. The third stomach (psalter) contains dry feed in hard
masses closely adherent to its walls.</p>

<p>In some cases the brain appears to become disordered, probably from the pain
and weakness and from the absorption of toxins generated in the digestive
canal. In such cases there is weakness and an unsteady gait, the animal does
not appear to take notice of and will consequently run against obstacles; after
a time it falls and gives up to violent and disordered movements. This
delirious condition is succeeded by coma or stupor, and death ensues.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Small quantities of roots, sweet silage, or selected grass
or hay should be offered several times daily. Very little feed should be
allowed. Aromatic and demulcent drafts may be given to produce a soothing
effect on the mucous lining of the stomachs and to promote digestion. Two<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> ounces of
camomile flowers should be boiled for 20 minutes in a quart of water and the
infusion on cooling should be given to the affected animal. This may be
repeated three or four times a day. When constipation is present the following
purgative may be administered: One pound of Glauber's salt dissolved in a quart
of linseed tea and a pint of molasses. After this purgative has acted, if there
is a lack of appetite and the animal does not ruminate regularly, the powder
mentioned in remarks on the treatment of chronic tympanites may be given
according to directions. The diet must be rather laxative and of an easily
digestible character after an attack of this form of indigestion. Feed should
be given in moderate quantities, as excess by overtaxing the digestive
functions may bring on a relapse. Ice-cold water should be avoided.</p>

<h5>INDIGESTION FROM DRINKING COLD WATER (COLIC).</h5>

<p>This disorder is produced by drinking copiously of cold water, which arrests
digestion and produces cramp of the fourth stomach, probably of the other
stomachs, and also of the bowels.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;It is not customary for the ox to drink much water at once.
In fact, he usually drinks slowly and as if he were merely tasting the water,
letting some fall out at the corners of his mouth at every mouthful. It would
therefore seem to be contrary to the habits of the ox to drink copiously; but
we find that during hot weather, when he has been working and is consequently
very thirsty, if he drinks a large quantity of cold water he may be immediately
taken with a very severe colic. Cows which are fed largely on dry hay drink
copiously, like the working ox, and become affected in precisely the same
manner. In such cases they are seized with a chill or fit of trembling before
the cramps come on.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;There is some distension of the abdomen, but no accumulation
of gas. As the distension and pain occur immediately after the animal has drunk
the water, there can be no doubt as to the exciting cause.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Walk the animal about for 10 minutes before administering
medicine, and this allows time for a portion of the contents of the stomach to
pass into the bowel, and renders it safer to give medicine. In many cases the
walking exercise and the diarrhea bring about a spontaneous cure of this
disorder, but as in some instances the cramps and pains of the stomachs
persist, one may give 1 ounce of sulphuric ether and 1 ounce of tincture of
opium, shaken up with a pint of warm water, and repeat the dose in half an hour
if the animal is not relieved. In an emergency when the medicine is not to be
had, a tablespoonful of powdered ginger may be administered in a pint of warm
water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
32]</a></span></p>

<h5>INDIGESTION IN CALVES (GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH, DIARRHEA, OR SCOUR).</h5>

<p>Calves are subject to a form of diarrhea to which the foregoing designations
have been applied.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Calves that suck their dams are not frequently affected with
this disease, though it may be occasioned by their sucking at long intervals
and thus overloading the stomach and bringing on indigestion, or from improper
feeding of the dam on soft, watery, or damaged feeds. Suckling the calf at
irregular times may also cause it. Exposure to damp and cold is a potent
predisposing cause. Calves separated from their dams and fed considerable
quantities of cold milk at long intervals are liable to contract this form of
indigestion. Calves fed on artificial feed, used as a substitute for milk,
frequently contract it. Damaged feed, sour or rotten milk, milk from dirty
cans, skim milk from a dirty creamery skim-milk vat, skim milk hauled warm,
exposed to the sun and fed from unclean buckets may all cause this disease.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The calf is depressed; appetite is poor; sometimes there is
fever; the extremities are cold. The dung becomes gradually softer and lighter
in color until it is cream colored and little thicker than milk. It has a most
offensive odor and may contain clumps of curd. Later it contains mucus and gas
bubbles. It sticks to the hair of the tail and buttocks, causing the hair to
drop off and the skin to become irritated. There may be pain on passing dung
and also abdominal or colicky pain. The calf stands about with the back arched
and belly contracted. There may be tympanites. Great weakness ensues in severe
cases, and without prompt and successful treatment death soon follows.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Remove the cause. Give appropriate feed of best quality in
small quantities. Make sure that the cow furnishing the milk is healthy and is
properly fed. Clean all milk vessels. Clean and disinfect the stalls. For the
diarrhea give two raw eggs or a cup of strong coffee. If the case is severe,
give 1 ounce of castor oil with a teaspoonful of creolin and 20 grains of
subnitrate of bismuth. Repeat the bismuth and creolin with flaxseed tea every
four hours. Tannopin may be used in doses of 15 to 30 grains.</p>

<p>Calves artificially fed on whole or skim milk should receive only such milk
as is sweet and has been handled in a sanitary manner. Milk should always be
warmed to the temperature of the body before feeding. When calves artificially
milk-fed develop diarrhea, the use of the following treatment has given
excellent results in many cases: Immediately after milking, or the separation
of the skim milk from the cream, formalin in the proportion of 1 to 4,000
should be added to the milk which is used for feeding; this may be closely
approximated by adding four drops of formalin to each quart<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> of milk. This
medicated milk should be fed to the calf in the usual quantity. When the
diarrhea is not controlled in three or four days by this treatment, the
additional use of some of the agents recommended above may assist in a
recovery.</p>

<h5>INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA; WHITE SCOUR.</h5>

<h5>[See chapter on Diseases of young calves, <a href="#Page_247">p. 247</a>.]</h5>

<h5>GASTROENTERITIS.</h5>

<p>This consists of an inflammation of the walls of the stomachs and of the
bowel.</p>

<p>Gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the walls of the stomachs and
intestines, follows upon irritations more severe or longer continued than those
that produce gastrointestinal catarrh.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Severe indigestion may be followed by gastroenteritis, or it
may be caused by swallowing irritant poisons, such as arsenic or corrosive
sublimate or irritant plants. Exposure to cold or inclement weather may produce
the disease, especially in debilitated animals or animals fed improperly. It is
asserted that if cattle feed on vegetation infested with some kinds of
caterpillars this disease may result.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Dullness; drooping of the ears; dryness of the muzzle; dry
skin; staring coat; loins morbidly sensitive to pressure; fullness of the left
flank, which is caused by the distention of the fourth stomach by gas. The
pulse is small, the gait is feeble and staggering; each step taken is
accompanied with a grunt, and this symptom is especially marked if the animal
walks in a downward direction. There is loss of appetite, and rumination is
suspended. The passages at first are few in number, hard, and are sometimes
coated with mucus or with blood. Later a severe diarrhea sets in, when the
passages contain mucus and blood and have an offensive odor. There is evidence
of colicky pain, and the abdomen is sensitive to pressure. Pain may be
continuous. There is fever and acceleration of pulse rate and respirations.
Mental depression and even insensibility occur before death. The disease is
always severe and often fatal.</p>

<p><em>Post-mortem appearances</em>.&mdash;The mucous membrane of the fourth stomach has
a well-marked red color and sometimes presents ulcerations. The wall is
thickened and softened, and similar conditions are found in the walls of the
intestines. The red discoloration extends in spots or large areas quite through
the wall, showing on the outside.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Very small quantities of carefully selected feed must be
given and the appetite must not be forced. Protect the animal well from cold
and dampness. Internally, give linseed tea, boiled milk, boiled oatmeal gruel,
or rice water. These protectives may carry the medicine. Tannopin in doses of
30 to 60 grains is good. Subnitrate of bismuth in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> doses of 1 to 2 drams may be
given. Pulverized opium may be used, if the diarrhea is severe, in 1 to 2 dram
doses. If the bowel movements are not free, one may give from a pint to a quart
of castor or raw linseed oil.</p>

<h5>TRAUMATIC INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.</h5>

<p>This disease results from the presence of a foreign body. This condition is
not rare in cattle, because these animals have the habit of swallowing their
feed without careful chewing, and so nails, screws, hairpins, ends of wire, and
other metal objects may be swallowed unconsciously. Such objects gravitate to
the second stomach, where they may be caught in the folds of the lining mucous
membrane, and in some instances the wall of this organ is perforated. From this
accident, chronic indigestion results. The symptoms, more or less
characteristic, are pain when getting up or lying down; grunting and pain upon
sudden motion, especially downhill; coughing; pain on pressure over the second
stomach, which lies immediately above the cartilaginous prolongation of the
sternum. If the presence of such a foreign body is recognized, it may be
removed by a difficult surgical operation, or, as is usually most economical,
the animal may be killed for beef, if there is no fever.</p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE BOWELS.</h4>

<h5>DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY.</h5>

<h5>[See also Gastrointestinal catarrh, <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>.]</h5>

<p>The word "dysentery," as it is commonly used in relation to the diseases of
animals, signifies a severe form of diarrhea.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Diarrhea is a symptom of irritation of the intestines,
resulting in increased secretion or increased muscular contractions, or both.
The irritation is sometimes the result of chilling from exposure, improper
feeding, irritant feeds, indigestion, organic diseases of the intestines, or
parasites.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Passages from the bowels are frequent, at first consisting
of thin dung, but as the disease continues they become watery and offensive
smelling, and may be even streaked with blood. At first the animal shows no
constitutional disturbance, but later it becomes weak and may exhibit evidence
of abdominal pain by looking around to the side, drawing the feet together,
lying down, or moving restlessly. Sometimes this malady is accompanied with
fever, great depression, loss of strength, rapid loss of flesh, and it may
terminate in death.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When the disease depends on irritating properties of the
feed which has been supplied to the animal, it is advisable to give a mild
purgative, such as a pint of castor or linseed oil. When the secretions of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> the bowels
are irritating, an ounce of carbonate of magnesia and half an ounce of tincture
of opium should be shaken up in a quart of linseed tea and given to the animal
three times a day until the passages present a natural appearance. When there
is debility, want of appetite, no fever, but a continuance of the watery
discharges from the bowels, then an astringent may be given. For such cases the
following is serviceable: Tannic acid, 1 ounce; powdered gentian, 2 ounces; mix
and divide into 12 powders, one powder to be given three times a day until the
passages present a natural appearance. Each powder may be mixed with a pint and
a half of water. Tannopin is a new remedy that is most useful in such cases.
The dose is from 30 grains to 2 drams. Useful household remedies are raw eggs,
strong coffee, parched rye flour, or decoction of oak bark. In all cases the
food must be given sparingly, and it should be carefully selected to insure
good quality. Complete rest in a box stall is desirable. When diarrhea is a
symptom of a malady characterized by the presence of a blood poison, the
treatment appropriate to such disease must be applied.</p>

<h5>SIMPLE ENTERITIS.</h5>

<h5>[See Gastroenteritis, <a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>.]</h5>

<h5>CROUPOUS ENTERITIS.</h5>

<p>Under certain conditions, severe irritation of the digestive canal may, in
cattle, cause a form of inflammation of the intestines (enteritis) that is
characterized by the formation of a false membrane upon the surface of the
lining membrane of the intestines, particularly the large ones.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;There is fever, depression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and
in the fecal masses shreds of leathery false membrane may be found. These
shreds are sometimes mistaken for parasites or for portions of the wall of the
intestine.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give a pound of Glauber's salt, followed by bicarbonate of
soda in doses of 2 ounces four times daily.</p>

<h4>ENTERITIS (OBSTRUCTION RESULTING FROM INVAGINATION, OR INTUSSUSCEPTION,
TWISTING, AND KNOTTING OF THE BOWELS).</h4>

<p>Inflammation may arise from a knot forming on some part of the small
intestine from the portion of the bowel becoming twisted on itself, or from one
part of the bowel slipping into another, which is termed invagination. This
form of enteritis occurs occasionally in animals of the bovine species.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;The small intestine, which in the ox rests on the right side
of the rumen, is, from the position which it occupies, predisposed to this
accident. It has been ascertained that animals which have shown symptoms of
this malady have trotted, galloped, or made other violent exertions in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> coming from
drinking, or that they have been chased by dogs or by animals of their own
species while at pasture. The accident is most likely to occur among cattle on
very hilly pastures. The danger of jumping or running is greatest when the
rumen is distended with food.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;This form of enteritis or obstruction is manifested by
severe colicky pains; the ox scrapes and strikes the ground with his front and
hind feet alternately; keeps lying down and getting up again; he keeps his tail
constantly raised and turns his nose frequently to his right flank; he is
frequently bloated, or tympanitic, on that side. He refuses feed and does not
ruminate, and for some hours suffers severe pains. At first he frequently
passes thin dung, and also urinates frequently, but passes only a little urine
at a time. On the second day the pains have become less acute; the animal
remains lying down; moans occasionally; his pulse is small and quick; he still
refuses feed and does not ruminate. At this stage he does not pass any dung,
though sometimes a small quantity of bloody mucus may be passed. The animal
passes very little urine. This condition may continue for a considerable time,
as cattle so affected may live for 15 or even 20 days.</p>

<p><em>Post-mortem appearance</em>.&mdash;At death the bowels are found to be misplaced
or obstructed, as mentioned above, and inflamed, the inflammation always
originating at the point where the intestine has been invaginated, twisted, or
knotted. Sometimes the part is gangrenous, the compression of the blood vessels
preventing circulation, and thus causing the death of the tissues.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Purgatives, anodynes, and other remedies are of no service
in such cases, and bleeding also fails to produce any benefit. Indeed, it is
usually true that in such cases treatment is useless. Some cases are recorded
in which an incision has been made in the flank, so as to enable the operator
to restore the intestine to its normal position or to remove the kink.</p>

<h5>CONSTIPATION.</h5>

<p>Constipation is to be regarded rather as a symptom of disease or of faults
in feeding than as a disease in itself. It occurs in almost all general fevers
unless the bowels are involved in local disease, in obstructions of all kinds,
from feeding on dry, bulky feed, etc. In order to remove the constipation the
treatment must be applied to remove the causes which give rise to it. Calves
sometimes suffer from constipation immediately after birth when the meconium
that accumulates in the bowels before birth is not passed. In such cases, give
a rectal injection of warm water and an ounce of castor oil shaken up with an
ounce of new milk. The mother's milk is the best food to prevent constipation
in the new-born calf, as it contains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> large amount of fatty matter which renders it
laxative in its effects.</p>

<p>It is usually better to treat habitual constipation by a change of diet than
by medicine. Flaxseed is a good feed laxative. If the constipation has lasted
long, repeated small doses of purgatives are better than a single large
dose.</p>

<h5>INTESTINAL WORMS.</h5>

<h5>[See chapter on "The animal parasites of cattle," <a href="#Page_502">p. 502</a>.]</h5>

<h5>RUPTURES (VENTRAL HERNIA).</h5>

<p>Ventral hernia, or rupture, is an escape of some one of the abdominal organs
through a rupture in the abdominal muscles, the skin remaining intact. The
rumen, the small intestine, or part of the large intestine, and the fourth
stomach are the parts which usually form a ventral hernia in bovine animals.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Hernia is frequently produced by blows of the horns, kicks,
and falls. In old cows hernia may sometimes occur without any direct injury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hernia of the rumen</span>.&mdash;Hernia of the rumen is
generally situated on the left side of the abdomen, on account of the situation
of the rumen. In exceptional cases it may take place on the right side, and in
such cases it also generally happens that some folds of the intestine pass into
the hernial sac. Hernias have been classified into simple or complicated,
recent or old, traumatic (from mechanical injury) or spontaneous.</p>

<p>In recent traumatic hernia there is swelling on the left side of the lower
part of the abdomen. The swelling is greatest in the cases of hernia which are
situated on the lower part of the abdomen. Unless an examination is made
immediately after the injury has been inflicted it is difficult, and sometimes
impossible, to ascertain the exact extent of the rupture, owing to the swelling
which subsequently takes place. Frequently there is no loss of appetite, fever,
or other general symptoms attending the injury. From the twelfth to the
fifteenth day the swelling has generally subsided to such an extent that it is
possible by an examination to determine the extent of the rupture.</p>

<p>In old cows what is termed spontaneous hernia may sometimes take place
without any direct injury. The occurrence of this form of hernia is explained
by the increase in the size of the abdomen, which takes place in an advanced
stage of pregnancy, causing a thinning and stretching of the muscular fibers,
which at last may rupture, or give way. Such hernias frequently occur about the
end of the period of gestation, and in some instances have contained the right
sac of the rumen, the omentum, the small and large intestines, a portion of the
liver, and the pregnant uterus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> In
old hernias the swelling is soft and elastic, and if they have not contracted
adhesions to the sides of the laceration, they can be made to disappear by
pressure carefully applied. Sometimes this accident is complicated by a rupture
of the rumen, constituting a complicated hernia. If a portion of the contents
of the rumen escape into the abdomen, the case will be aggravated by the
occurrence of peritonitis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hernia of the bowel</span>.&mdash;When the intestines
(<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl. III</a>, fig. 6) form the contents of the hernia, it
will be situated at the right side of the abdomen. In an intestinal hernia the
swelling is usually not painful, of a doughy consistence or elastic, according
as the intestine does or does not contain alimentary matter. This swelling can
generally be made to disappear by pressure, and when it has been reduced one
can easily recognize the direction and extent of the hernial opening. Hernias
of the bowel which are situated at the upper and right side of the abdomen are
usually formed by the small intestine. They are less easily reduced than a
hernia in a lower situation, but when reduction has been effected they are less
readily reproduced than those occurring lower. In hernias of the small
intestine, adhesion of the protruding parts to the walls of the opening, or
strangulation, are complications which sometimes take place. If adhesion has
taken place the hernia can not be reduced by pressure, and when strangulation
has occurred the animal shows symptoms of pain&mdash;is restless, turns its
nose to the painful part, and shows those symptoms which are usually
collectively designated under the term colic. If relief is not afforded, the
animal will die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hernia of the rennet, or fourth
stomach</span>.&mdash;This disease occasionally occurs in calves and is usually
caused by a blow from a cow's horn on the right flank of the calf. After such
an accident a swelling forms on the right flank near the last rib. This
swelling may be neither hot nor painful, even at first, and is soft to the
touch. It can be made to disappear by careful pressure, when the sides of the
aperture through which it has passed can be felt. The application of pressure
so as to cause the disappearance of the hernia is best made immediately after
the occurrence of the accident, or when the edema which accompanies the
swelling has disappeared.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When a hernia is reducible&mdash;that is, can be pushed
back into the abdomen&mdash;then, if it is of recent occurrence, it is
advisable to maintain the natural position of the parts by bandaging and to
allow the walls of the laceration to grow together. The bowels should be kept
reasonably empty by avoiding the use of bulky feed, and the animal must be kept
quiet.</p>

<p>The following method of bandaging is recommended by Bouley:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>First prepare a bandage (must be of strong material), about 10 yards long
and between 3 and 4 inches broad, and a flexible and solid piece of pasteboard
adapted in size to the surface of the hernia. The protruding<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> organ must
then be replaced in the abdomen and maintained in that position during the
application of the bandage. This being done, a layer of melted pitch and
turpentine is quickly spread on the skin covering the seat of the hernia, so as
to extend somewhat beyond that space. This adhesive layer is then covered with
a layer of fine tow, then a new layer of pitch and turpentine is spread on the
tow, and the piece of pasteboard is applied on the layer of pitch, its outer
surface being covered with the same preparation. Lastly, the bandage, adhering
to the piece of pasteboard, to the skin, and to the different turns which it
makes around the body, is carefully applied so as to form an immovable, rigid,
and solid bandage, which will retain the hernia long enough for the wound in
the abdominal walls to heal permanently.</p>
</div>

<p>If the hernia is old and small it may be treated by injecting a strong
solution of common salt about the edges of the tear. This causes swelling and
inflammation, which, respectively, forces the protruded organ back and closes
the opening. There is some risk attached to this method of treatment.</p>

<p>In small, old, ventral hernias the method of compressing and sloughing off
the skin has been used successfully. If the hernia is large a radical operation
will be necessary, and this is also true when the symptoms indicate that a
hernia is strangulated. This operation is performed by cutting down on the
hernia, restoring the organ to the abdominal cavity, and then closing the wound
with two sets of stitches; the inner stitches, in the muscular wall, should be
made with catgut and the outer stitches, in the skin, may be made with silk or
silver wire. The strictest surgical cleanliness must be observed. Bleeding
vessels should be tied. Then a compress composed of ten or twelve folds of
cloth must be placed smoothly over the seat of injury and a bandage applied
around the body, the two ends being fastened at the back. In the smaller kinds
of hernia, nitric acid may sometimes be applied with success. This treatment
should not be applied until the swelling and inflammation attending the
appearance of the hernia have subsided; then, the contents of the hernia having
been returned, the surface of skin corresponding to it is sponged over with a
solution composed of 1 part of nitric acid to 2 of water. This treatment acts
by exciting considerable inflammation, which has the effect of causing
swelling, and thus frequently closing the hernial opening and preventing the
contents of the sac from returning. A second application should not be made
until the inflammation excited by the first has subsided. In what is termed
spontaneous hernia it is useless to apply any kind of treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Umbilical hernia</span>.&mdash;The umbilicus, or navel,
is the aperture through which the blood vessels pass from the mother to the
fetus, and naturally the sides of this aperture ought to adhere or unite after
birth. In very young animals, and sometimes in newborn calves, this aperture in
the abdominal muscles remains open and a part of the bowel or a portion of the
mesentery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
40]</a></span> may slip through the opening, constituting what is called
umbilical hernia. The wall of the sac is formed by the skin, which is covered
on the inner surface by a layer of cellular tissue, and within this there is
sometimes, but not always, a layer of peritoneum. The contents of the hernia
may be formed by a part of the bowel, by a portion of the peritoneum, or may
contain portions of both peritoneum and bowel. When the sac contains only the
peritoneum it has a doughy feel, but when it is formed by a portion of the
bowel it is more elastic on pressure.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;In the new-born animal the opening of the navel is generally
large, and may sometimes give way to the pressure of the bowel on account of
the weak and relaxed condition of the abdominal muscles. This defective and
abnormal condition of the umbilicus is frequently hereditary. It may be
occasioned by roughly pulling away the umbilical cord; through kicks or blows
on the belly; through any severe straining by which the sides of the navel are
stretched apart. We may mention in this connection that it is best in new-born
calves to tie the umbilical cord tightly about 2 inches from the navel, and
then to leave it alone, when in most cases it will drop off in a few days,
leaving the navel closed.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;It is well to bear in mind that many, and especially the
smaller, umbilical hernias heal spontaneously; that is, nature effects a cure.
As the animal gets older the abdominal muscles get stronger and possess more
power of resistance to pressure, the bowels become larger and do not pass so
readily through a small opening, so that from a combination of causes there is
a gradual growing together or adhesion of the sides of the navel. In cases of
umbilical hernia in which there are no indications that a spontaneous cure will
take place, the calf should be laid on its back; immediately on this being done
the hernia will often disappear into the abdomen. If it does not, its reduction
may be brought about by gentle handling, endeavoring, if need be, to empty the
organs forming the hernia before returning them into the abdomen. After the
hernia has been returned, the hair should be clipped from the skin covering it
and a compress composed of 10 or 12 folds of linen or cotton should be applied,
first smearing the skin with pitch and then a bandage about 3 inches wide
should be passed round the body so as to retain the compress in position. The
lower part of the compress should be smeared with pitch, and also those
portions of the bandage which pass over it, so as to keep it solid and prevent
it from shifting. In some cases it will be found that the contents of the sac
can not be returned into the abdomen, and this generally arises from the fact
that some part of the contents of the sac has grown to or become adherent to
the edges of the umbilical opening. In such a case the skin must be carefully
laid open in the long direction, the adhesions of the protruding organs
carefully separated from the umbilicus, and after the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> protruding parts have been
returned into the abdomen, the sides of the umbilicus must be freshened if
necessary by paring, and then the edges of the opening brought together by
catgut stitches; the wound in the skin must then also be brought together by
stitches. The wound must be carefully dressed every day and a bandage passed
round the body so as to cover and protect the part operated on.</p>

<p>In small hernias nitric acid has been used successfully in the same manner
as has been described in the treatment of ventral hernia. Sulphuric acid has
also been used for a similar purpose, diluting it to the extent of 1 part of
acid to 3 or 5 of water. In thin-skinned animals the weaker preparations ought
to be preferred, and caution must be exercised in using such preparations so as
not to destroy the tissues on which they are applied.</p>

<p>Another method of treatment is, after the contents of the sac have been
returned into the abdomen, to tie a piece of strong waxed cord round the
pendulous portion which formed the outer covering of the hernia. The string is
apt to slacken after two or three days, when a new piece of cord should be
applied above the first one. The constriction of the skin sets up inflammation,
which generally extends to the umbilicus and causes the edges to adhere
together, and by the time the portion of skin below the ligature has lost its
vitality and dropped off, the umbilicus is closed and there is no danger of the
abdominal organs protruding through it. This is what takes place when this
method has a favorable result, though if the umbilicus does not become adherent
and the skin sloughs, the bowels will protrude through the opening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gut-tie (peritoneal hernia)</span>.&mdash;In peritoneal
hernia of the ox a loop or knuckle of intestine enters from the abdomen into a
rent in that part of the peritoneum which is situated at the margin of the hip
bone or it passes under the remains of the spermatic cord, the end of which may
be grown fast to the inner inguinal ring. The onward pressure of the bowel, as
well as the occasional turning of the latter round the spermatic cord, is the
cause of the cord exercising considerable pressure on the bowel, which
occasions irritation, obstructs the passage of excrement, and excites
inflammation, which terminates in gangrene and death.</p>

<p>The rent in the peritoneum is situated at the upper and front part of the
pelvis, nearer to the sacrum than the pubes.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Among the causes of peritoneal hernia considerable importance
is attached to a method of castration which is practiced in certain districts,
viz, the tearing or rupturing of the spermatic cord by main force instead of
dividing it at a proper distance above the testicle in a surgical manner. After
this violent and rough method of operating, the cord retracts into the abdomen
and its stump becomes adherent to some part of the peritoneum, or it may wind
around the bowel and then the stump becomes<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> adherent, so that strangulation
of the bowel results. The rough dragging on the cord may also cause a tear in
the peritoneum, the result of which need not be described. The severe exertion
of ascending hills and mountains, drawing heavy loads, or the straining which
oxen undergo while fighting each other may also give rise to peritoneal
hernia.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The ox suddenly becomes very restless, stamps with his feet,
moves backward and forward, hurriedly lies down, rises, moves his tail
uneasily, and kicks at his belly with the foot of the affected side. The pain
evinced may diminish but soon returns again. In the early stage there are
frequent passages of dung, but after the lapse of 18 or 24 hours this ceases,
the bowel apparently being emptied to the point of strangulation, and the
passages now consist only of a little mucus mixed with blood. When injections
are given at this time the water passes out of the bowel without even being
colored. The animal lies down on the side where the hernia exists and stretches
out his hind feet in a backward direction. These two particular symptoms serve
to distinguish this affection from enteritis and invagination of the bowel. As
time passes the animal becomes quieter, but this cessation of pain may indicate
that gangrene of the bowel has set in, and may, therefore, under certain
circumstances, be considered a precursor of death. Gangrene may take place in
from four to six days, when perforation of the bowel may occur and death result
in a short time.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>&mdash;In the first place the ox should be examined by passing the
oiled hand and arm into the rectum; the hand should be passed along the margin
of the pelvis, beginning at the sacrum and continuing downward toward the
inguinal ring, when a soft, painful swelling will be felt, which may vary from
the size of an apple to that of the two fists. This swelling will be felt to be
tightly compressed by the spermatic cord. It very rarely happens that there is
any similar swelling on the left side, though in such cases it is best to make
a thorough examination. The bowel has sometimes been released from its position
by driving the ox down a hill; by causing him to jump from a height of 2 feet
to the ground; the expedient of trotting him also has been resorted to with the
hope that the jolting movement might bring about a release of the bowel. If the
simple expedients mentioned have been tried and failed, then the hand being
passed into the rectum should be pressed gently on the swelling in an upward
and forward direction, so as to endeavor to push the imprisoned portion of the
bowel back into the abdomen. While this is being done the ox's hind feet should
stand on higher ground than the front, so as to favor the slipping out of the
bowel by its own weight, and at the same time an assistant should squeeze the
animal's loins, so as to cause it to bend downward and so relax the band formed
by the spermatic cord. If the imprisoned portion of gut is<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> freed, which
may be ascertained by the disappearance of the swelling, the usual sounds
produced by the bowels moving in the abdomen will be heard, and in a few hours
the feces and urine will be passed as usual. If the means mentioned fail to
release the imprisoned portion of the gut, then an incision about 4 inches long
must be made in the right flank in a downward direction, the hand introduced
into the abdomen, the situation and condition of swelling exactly ascertained,
and then a probe-pointed knife inserted between the imprisoned bowel and band
compressing it, and turned outward against the band, the latter being then
cautiously divided and the imprisoned gut allowed to escape, or, if necessary,
the bowel should be drawn gently from its position into the abdomen. The wound
in the flank must be brought together in the same way as in the case of the
wound made in operating for impaction of the rumen.</p>

<h5>WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN.</h5>

<p>A wound of the abdomen may merely penetrate the skin; but as such cases are
not attended with much danger, nor their treatment with much difficulty, we
will consider here merely those wounds which penetrate the entire thickness of
the abdominal walls and expose to a greater or less extent the organs contained
in that cavity.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Such accidents may be occasioned by falling on fragments of
broken glass or other sharp objects. A blow from the horn of another animal may
penetrate the abdomen. Exposure and protrusion of some of the abdominal organs
may also be occasioned by the incautious use of caustics in the treatment of
umbilical or ventral hernia. The parts which generally escape through an
abdominal wound are the small intestine and floating colon.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms.</em>&mdash;When the abdominal wound is small, the bowel exposed
presents the appearance of a small round tumor, but in a few moments a loop of
intestine may emerge from the opening. The animal then shows symptoms of severe
pain by pawing with his feet, which has the effect of accelerating the passage
of new loops of intestine through the wound, so that the mass which they form
may even touch the ground. The pain becomes so great that the ox now not only
paws but lies down and rolls, thus tearing and crushing his bowels. In such
cases it is best to slaughter the animal at once; but in the case of a valuable
animal in which tearing and crushing of the bowels has not taken place the
bowels should be washed with freshly boiled water reduced to the temperature of
the body and returned and the wounds in the muscle and skin brought together in
a manner somewhat similar to that described in speaking of ventral hernia.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE LIVER AND SPLEEN.</h4>

<h5>JAUNDICE (THE YELLOWS, OR CONGESTION OF THE LIVER).</h5>

<p>When jaundice exists, there is a yellow appearance of the white of the eyes
and of the mucous membrane of the mouth. A similar aspect of the skin may also
be observed in animals which are either partly or altogether covered with white
hair. Jaundice is then merely a symptom of disease and ought to direct
attention to ascertaining, if possible, the cause or causes which have given
rise to it. A swollen condition of the mucous membrane of that part of the
bowel called the duodenum may produce jaundice, as that mechanically closes the
orifice of the biliary duct. In constipation there is an inactive or torpid
condition of the bowel, and the bile which passes into the intestine may be
absorbed and cause the yellow staining of jaundice. Jaundice is one of the
symptoms of Texas fever. It may also arise from the presence of parasites or
gallstones in the ducts, forming a mechanical obstruction to the onward flow of
bile. The conditions under which jaundice most commonly calls for treatment are
when cattle have been highly fed and kept in a state of inactivity. At such
time there is an excess of nutritive elements carried into the blood, which is
associated with increased fullness of the portal vein and hepatic artery. When
continued high feeding has produced this congested state of the liver, the
functions of that organ become disordered, so that a considerable portion of
the bile, instead of being excreted and passing into the intestine, is absorbed
by the hepatic veins.</p>

<p>The structure of the liver is shown in <a href="#PLATE_IV">Plate IV</a>.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;This disease, although rare, occurs most frequently among
stall-fed cattle. Pressure along the margin of the short ribs on the right side
produces pain; the appetite is poor and the animal shows hardly any inclination
to drink; the mucous membranes of the eye and mouth are yellow, the urine has a
yellow or brown appearance, the animal lies down much and moves with
reluctance, moans occasionally, and has a tottering gait. The ears and horns
are alternately hot and cold; in cows the secretion of milk is much diminished,
and that which is secreted has a bitter taste; sometimes the animal has a dry,
painful cough and presents a dull, stupefied appearance.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In such cases it is advisable to produce a free action of
the bowels, so as to remove the usually congested condition of the portal vein
and liver. For this purpose the administration of the following dose is
recommended: Sulphate of soda, 16 ounces; molasses, 1 pint; warm water, 1
quart. The sulphate of soda is dissolved by stirring it up in tepid water.
Following this the animal should have a heaping tablespoonful of artificial
Carlsbad salt in the feed three times daily. This treatment may be assisted by
giving occasional injections of warm water and soap. The diet should be<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> laxative and
moderate in quantity and may consist of coarse bran mash, pulped roots, grass
in the season, and hay in moderate quantity.</p>

<h5>HEPATITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER).</h5>

<p>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and usually occurs as a
complication of some infectious disease. It may also occur as a complication of
gastrointestinal catarrh or in hot weather from overheating or damaged (putrid
or fermented) feeds.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are sometimes obscure and their real
significance is frequently overlooked. The most prominent symptoms are
yellowness of the white of the eye and of the membrane lining the mouth; the
appetite is poor, the body presents an emaciated appearance, the feces are
light colored, while the urine is likely to be unusually dark; there is thirst,
and pain is caused by pressing over the liver. The gait is weak and the animal
lies down more than usual, and while doing so frequently rests its head on the
side of its chest.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give a purge of Glauber's salt and after it has operated
give artificial Carlsbad salts in each feed, as advised under "Jaundice." Give
green feed and plenty of water. Oil of turpentine should be rubbed in well once
a day over the region of the liver. The skin on which it should be applied
extends from the false ribs on the right side to 6 inches in front of the last
one, and from the backbone to 12 inches on the right side of it.</p>

<h5>FLUKE DISEASE.</h5>

<h5>[See chapter on "The animal parasites of cattle," <a href="#Page_502">p. 502</a>.]</h5>

<h5>SPLENITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE SPLEEN).</h5>

<p>This disease occurs almost solely as a result of the existence of some
infectious disease, and the symptoms caused by it merge with the symptoms of
the accompanying causative disease. The spleen is seriously involved and
becomes enlarged and soft in Texas fever, anthrax, and blood poisoning.</p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE PERITONEUM.</h4>

<h5>PERITONITIS.</h5>

<p>Peritonitis consists of an inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the
thin, delicate membrane that lines the abdomen and covers the abdominal
organs.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Wounds are the usual cause in cattle. The wound may be of the
abdominal wall or of the intestines, stomach, or uterus; or inflammation may
extend from one of the organs of the abdominal cavity to the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> peritoneum;
so this disease may complicate enteritis or inflamed womb. A sharp metal body
may perforate the second stomach and allow the gastric contents to escape,
irritating the peritoneum. This disease may follow castration or operation for
hernia.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;A continuous or occasional shivering; the animal lies down,
but appears uneasy; it frequently turns its head toward its belly and lows
plaintively; pressure on the flanks produces pain; has no appetite; muzzle is
dry and no rumination; while standing, its legs are placed well under its body;
pulse small and hard. The evacuations from the bowels are dry and hard. If this
disease is complicated by the presence of inflammation of the bowels, the pain
is more severe and the animal is more restless. The skin is cold and dry in the
early stage of this disease, but in a more advanced stage this condition may be
succeeded by heat of the skin and quick breathing. The fits of trembling,
uneasiness, small and hard pulse, and tension of the left flank are symptoms
the presence of which would enable one to reach the conclusion that peritonitis
exists.</p>

<p><em>Post-mortem appearance</em>.&mdash;The membrane lining the abdomen and covering
the surface of the bowels is reddened to a greater or less extent, and there is
usually considerable serous, or watery, fluid collected in the abdomen.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When we have to do with the form of peritonitis resulting
from an injury, as when the horn of another animal has been thrust through the
abdominal walls, this lesion must be treated in accordance with directions
before given, but the general treatment must be similar to that which follows.
Peritonitis resulting from castration or from parturient fever must also be
treated in connection with the special conditions which give rise to it, as the
general treatment of this disease must be modified to some extent by the
exciting cause.</p>

<p>The aim must be to discover and remove the cause. The cause must be treated
according to its nature. Harms strongly recommends borax in the treatment of
peritonitis. He gives 6 ounces in the first 24 hours, divided into three doses,
and afterwards he gives 6 drams three times daily. Opium in doses of 2 to 3
drams may be given. To bring on evacuations of the bowels it is better to give
rectal injections than to administer purges. The strength may be sustained by
coffee or camphor.</p>

<p>The body should be warmly clothed, and it is advisable, when practicable, to
have a blanket which has been wrung out of hot water placed over the abdomen,
then covered by several dry blankets, which are maintained in position by
straps or ropes passing round the body. The wet blanket must be changed as it
cools&mdash;the object of treatment being to warm the surface of the body and
to determine as much blood to the skin as possible. The diet should consist of
laxative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
food and drinks, such as linseed tea. If peritonitis assumes chronic form the
diet should be nutritious, such as selected clover hay, linseed cake, grass,
etc., and iodid of potassium should be given three times a day in gram doses
dissolved in a pint of water.</p>

<h5>DROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN (ASCITES).</h5>

<p>In this disease there is a serous, or watery, effusion in the cavity of the
abdomen.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;When old animals are fed on innutritious feed or when reduced
by disease, they become anemic; in other words, their blood becomes
impoverished and dropsy may follow. An innutritious and insufficient diet
produces the same effect in young animals. It is one of the results of
peritonitis, and may also arise from acute or chronic inflammation of the
liver, such as is of common occurrence when flukes are present in the liver in
large numbers. Heart disease and chronic lung disease may be followed by
ascites. It is sometimes, in calves, a symptom of infestation with worms.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;A gradual increase in the size of the abdomen at its lower
part, while the flanks becomes hollow; pallor of the mucous membrane of the
mouth and eye; weak and sluggish gait; want of appetite, and irregularity in
ruminating. On percussion or tapping the surface of the abdomen with the
fingers, a dull sound is produced. If the hand and arm are oiled and passed
into the rectum as far as possible, on moving the hand from one side to the
other the fluctuation caused by the presence of fluid in the abdomen may be
felt.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If possible the cause must be discovered and removed. The
diet should be nutritious, and in those cases in which we have merely to deal
with anemia (the bloodless state) arising from insufficient diet, the use of
tonics and diuretics, at the same time keeping the skin warm, may bring about a
gradual absorption of the fluid contained in the abdomen. One of the following
powders may be mixed with the animal's feed three times a day; or, if there is
any uncertainty as to its being taken in that way, it should be mixed with
sirup, so as to form a paste, and smeared well back on the animal's tongue with
a flat wooden spoon: Carbonate of iron, 3 ounces; powdered gentian, 3 ounces;
powdered nitrate of potassium, 3 ounces; mix and divide into 12 powders. The
administration of purgatives which promote a watery discharge from the mucous
surface of the bowels also tends, by diminishing the serum of the blood, to
bring about absorption and a gradual removal of the fluid contained in the
abdomen. Large doses should not be given, but moderate ones should be
administered morning and night, so as to produce a laxative effect on the
bowels for several days. To attain this end the following may be used: Sulphate
of soda, 8 ounces; powdered ginger, half an ounce; to be mixed in 2 quarts of
tepid water and given at one dose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"

The lines indicate the course of the food in the stomachs. The incompletely
masticated food passes down the esophagus, or gullet, into the first and second
stomachs, in which a churning motion is kept up, carrying the food from side to
side and from stomach to stomach. From the first stomach regurgitation takes
place; that is, the food is returned through the gullet to the mouth to be more
thoroughly chewed, and this constitutes what is known as "chewing the cud."
From the second stomach the food passes into the third, and from the third into
the fourth, or true, stomach, and from there into the intestines.</p>

<p class="dop2">Fig. 1. Clinical thermometer, 4/5 natural size. This is used to determine
the temperature of the animal body. The thermometer is passed into the rectum
after having been moistened with a little saliva from the mouth, or after
having had a little oil or lard rubbed upon it to facilitate its passage. There
it is allowed to remain two or three minutes, then withdrawn, and the
temperature read as in any ordinary thermometer. The clinical thermometer is
made self-registering; that is, the mercury in the stem remains at the height
to which it was forced by the heat of the body until it is shaken back into the
bulb by taking hold of the upper portion of the instrument and giving it a
short, sharp swing. The normal temperature of cattle varies from 100&#176; to
103&#176; F. In young animals it is somewhat higher than in old. The thermometer
is a very useful instrument and frequently is the means by which disease is detected
before the appearance of any external sign.</p>

<h2><a name="POISONS_AND_POISONING" id="POISONS_AND_POISONING"></a>POISONS AND
POISONING.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">V. T. Atkinson, V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by C. Dwight Marsh, Ph. D.]</h5>

<h4>DEFINITION OF A POISON.</h4>

<p>To define clearly the meaning of the word "poison" is somewhat difficult.
Even in law the word has never been defined, and when a definition is attempted
we are apt to include either too much or too little. The following definition
given by Husemann is perhaps the best: "Poisons are those substances, inorganic
or organic, existing in the organism or introduced from the outside, produced
artificially or formed as natural products, which, through their chemical
nature, under definite conditions, so affect some organ of a living organism
that the health or well-being of the organism is temporarily or chronically
injured." The common conception of a poison is any substance which, in small
quantity, will destroy life, except such as act by purely mechanical means, as,
for example, powdered glass.</p>

<p>Some substances that are not usually looked upon as poisons may destroy life
if given in large doses, such as common salt. Other substances which are
perfectly harmless when taken into the body in the usual way are poisons if
injected into the circulation, such as distilled water, milk, or glycerin.
Living organisms are not "chemical substances," and are not considered in this
connection.</p>

<h4>SOURCES OF POISONING.</h4>

<p>Poisoning may come from many causes, among the chief of which are the
following:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Errors in medication</em>.&mdash;By using the wrong substance or too large
dose an animal may be poisoned.</p>

<p>(2) <em>The exposure of poisons used for horticultural, technical, or other
legitimate purposes</em>.&mdash;Poisons used for spraying plants, disinfecting,
poisoning vermin, dipping cattle or sheep, painting, smelting, dyeing, or other
purposes may be so handled as to come within the reach of animals.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Damaged food</em>.&mdash;Food that has undergone putrefaction or certain
kinds of fermentation or heating, may have become poisonous, producing forage
poisoning, meat poisoning, cheese poisoning, etc.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Poisonous plants in the pasture or forage</em>.</p>

<p>(5) <em>The bite or sting of a poisonous insect or the bite of an animal</em>.</p>

<p>(6) <em>Malicious poisoning</em>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>THE ACTION OF POISONS.</h4>

<p>The action of poisons may be either local, and exerted directly on the
tissues with which they come in contact, or remote, acting through the
circulation or the nervous system; or both local and remote action may be
exerted by the same drug. Poisons which act locally generally either destroy by
corrosion the tissues with which they come in contact or by inhalation set up
acute inflammation. When any corrosive agent is taken into the stomach in
poisonous quantities, a group of symptoms is developed which is common to all.
The tissues with which the agent comes in contact are destroyed, sloughing and
acute inflammation of the surrounding structures take place; intense pain in
the abdomen and death ensue. In a like manner, but with less rapidity, the same
result is reached if the agent used be not of a sufficiently corrosive nature
to destroy the tissues, but sufficiently irritating to set up acute
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the digestive tract. If the poison
exerts a remote influence alone, the action is quite different, little or no
local effect being produced upon the digestive organs.</p>

<p>To produce an effect on some part of the body distant from the channel of
entrance, a poison must have been absorbed and carried in the blood to the
central nervous system or other region involved. The poisonous effect of any
substance is modified by the quantity used; by its chemical combinations; by
the part of the animal structure with which it comes in contact; by the
physical condition of the subject; and also by the rapidity with which the
poison is excreted. As an illustration, opium may be given with safety in much
larger doses to an animal suffering from acute pain than to one free from pain,
and to an adult animal with greater safety than to a young one. The rapidity
with which the poison is absorbed, owing to the part of the body with which it
is brought in contact, is also an important factor. So marked is this quality
that some agents which have the power of destroying life with almost absolute
certainty when introduced beneath the skin, may be taken into the stomach
without causing inconvenience, as curara, the arrow poisons, or the venomous
secretion of snakes. Other agents in chemical combination may tend to
intensify, lessen, or wholly neutralize the poisonous effect. For example,
arsenic in itself has well-marked poisonous properties, but when brought in
contact with dialyzed iron it forms an insoluble compound and becomes
innocuous. Idiosyncrasies are not so noticeable in cattle practice as in
practice among human beings, but the uncertainty with which some drugs exert
their influence would lead us to believe that well-marked differences in
susceptibility exist. Even in some cases a tolerance for poison is engendered,
so that in a herd of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
53]</a></span>animals equally exposed injurious or fatal effects do
not appear with uniformity. For example, among cattle that are compelled to
drink water holding in solution a salt of lead the effects of the poisoning
will be found varying all the way from fatality to imperceptibility.</p>

<h4>GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF POISONING.</h4>

<p>It is not always easy to differentiate between poisoning and some disease.
Indeed, examination during the life of the animal is sometimes wholly
inadequate to the formation of an opinion as to whether the case is one of
poisoning or, if it is, as to what the poison may be. A chemical and physical
examination after the death of the animal may be necessary to clear up the
doubt. On the other hand, the symptoms may be of such a nature as to point
unmistakably to poisoning with a certain agent. In general, the following
classes of symptoms may be regarded as indicative of poisoning: Sudden onset of
the disease without visible cause, a number of animals being similarly affected
at once, with severe gastrointestinal disorder or derangement of the nervous
system, or both; sudden alteration of heart action in relation to frequency,
force, or rhythm; local irritation, dyspnea, or change in the urine or
urination.</p>

<p>After death, lesions of the greatest variety may be found, and it is
necessary for one to be skilled in anatomy and pathology in order to determine
their significance. Oftentimes the stomach and intestines are red, have thick
walls, and contain blood. This signifies a severe irritant, such as arsenic or
corrosive sublimate. Other alterations sometimes found are inflammation of the
kidneys or bladder, points of hemorrhage in various organs, changes in the
blood, congestion of the lungs, and certain microscopic changes.</p>

<h4>GENERAL TREATMENT.</h4>

<p>The treatment of animals suffering from poison must vary according to the
nature of the toxic agent. There are a few general plans of action, however,
which should be followed so far as possible. In man and in some of the smaller
animals it is possible to eliminate unabsorbed poison by the use of the stomach
pump or by causing vomiting. These proceedings are impracticable in cattle. It
is well, therefore, in many cases to endeavor to expel the unabsorbed poison by
emptying the digestive tract, so far as may be, with a nonirritating purge.
Castor oil in doses of 1 pint to 2 quarts is adapted to this purpose. If the
poison is known to be nonirritant&mdash;as a narcotic plant&mdash;from 10 to 20
drops of croton oil may be given with a quart of castor oil. When poisons are
somewhat prolonged in their effect, Epsom salt in doses of 1 pound can be given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
advantageously. To protect the mucous membrane from the action of strong
irritants, one may give flaxseed tea, barley water, the whites of eggs, milk,
butter, olive oil, or fresh lard. Chemical antidotes may sometimes be used for
special poisons, as advised below. In general, if an acid has been taken it may
be neutralized with an alkali, such as chalk, magnesia, bicarbonate of soda
(baking soda), ammonia (diluted), or soap. If the poison is an alkali, such as
caustic soda or potash (lye), or ammonia, an acid, such as diluted (1 per cent)
sulphuric acid or vinegar, may be administered. Special treatments and
antidotes are considered below.</p>

<p>A poisonous agent may be so gradually introduced into the system as to
slowly develop the power of resistance against its own action. In other cases
where the poison is introduced slowly the poisonous action becomes
accumulative, and, although there is no increase in the quantity taken, violent
symptoms are suddenly developed, as if the whole amount, the consumption of
which may have extended over a considerable period, had been given in one dose.
Other agents, poisonous in their nature, tend to deteriorate some of the
important organs, and, interfering with their natural functions, are productive
of conditions of ill health which, although not necessarily fatal, are
important. Such might properly be called chronic poisons. Poisons of themselves
dangerous when administered in large doses are used medicinally for curative
purposes, and a very large percentage of the pharmaceutical preparations used
in the practice of medicine if given in excessive quantities may produce
serious results. In the administration of medicines, therefore, care should be
exercised not only that the animal is not poisoned by the administration of an
excessive dose but that injury is not done by continued treatment with
medicines the administration of which is not called for.</p>

<h4>MINERAL POISONS.</h4>

<h5>ARSENIC POISONING.</h5>

<p>Of the common irritant and corrosive poisons, arsenic, especially one of its
compounds (Paris green), is likely to be the most dangerous to our class of
patients. The common practice of using Paris green and other compounds of
arsenic as insecticides for the destruction of potato beetle and other insect
enemies of the farmer and fruit grower has had the effect of introducing it
into almost all farming establishments. White arsenic is also a principal
ingredient in some popular dipping preparations, and poisoning from this source
occasionally takes place when, after dipping, animals are allowed to run in a
yard in which there is loose fodder. The drippings from the animals falling on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the fodder render it poisonous and dangerous to animal life if eaten. Familiarity
with its use has in many instances tended to breed contempt for its potency as
a poison. Rat poisons often contain arsenic. The excessive use of arsenic as a
tonic, or of "condition powders" containing arsenic, has been the means of
poisoning many animals. This is the common poison used by malicious persons
with criminal intent. The poison may also be absorbed through wounds or through
the skin if used as a dip or bath.</p>

<p>If a large dose is given, at once acute poisoning is produced; if repeated
small doses are given, chronic poisoning may result. The poisonous dose for an
ox is from 3 drams to 1 ounce.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of acute poisoning first appear as those of
colic; the animal is restless, stamping with the feet, lying down and getting
up. There is tenderness on pressure over the abdomen. The acute symptoms
increase; in a few hours violent diarrhea is developed; in many cases blood and
shreds of detached mucous membrane are mixed with the evacuations. There is
irregular and feeble pulse and respiration, and death is likely to supervene
between the eighteenth hour and the third day. If the latter period is passed,
there is a reasonable hope of recovery.</p>

<p>In chronic poisoning the symptoms are similar to those of chronic
gastrointestinal catarrh, with indigestion, diarrhea, and general weakness and
loss of condition.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The antidote for arsenic is a solution of hydrated oxid of
iron in water. It should be prepared fresh by mixing a solution of sulphate of
iron, made by dissolving 4 ounces of sulphate of iron in one-half pint water,
with a suspension of 1 ounce of magnesia in one-half pint water. This quantity
is sufficient for one dose for a cow and may be repeated in an hour, if much
arsenic was taken. A solution of calcined magnesia or powdered iron or iron
filings or iron scale from a blacksmith's forge may be given in the absence of
other remedies. Powdered sulphur is of some value as an antidote. One must also
administer protectives, such as linseed tea, barley water, whites of eggs,
etc.</p>

<h5>LEAD POISONING.</h5>

<p>Lead poisoning of cattle sometimes comes from their having licked freshly
painted surfaces and thus swallowed compounds containing white lead. In several
instances cattle have been poisoned by silage from a silo painted inside with
lead paint shortly before filling. Sometimes cattle eat dried paint scrapings
with apparent relish and are poisoned. Cattle grazing on rifle ranges have been
poisoned by lead from the bullets. Sugar of lead has been administered by mistake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
for Glauber's salt. Lead poisoning may be acute or chronic. The fatal dose of sugar
of lead is from 1 to 4 ounces. Water drawn from lead pipes or held in a
lead-lined tank may cause poisoning.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are generally dullness, lying down with the
head turned toward the flank, colic, rumbling in the abdomen, loss of control
of the limbs when walking, twitching, champing of the jaws, moving in a circle,
convulsions, delirium, violent bellowing, followed by stupor and death. The
symptoms generally extend over considerable time but may end in death after 24
hours.</p>

<p><em>Chronic lead poisoning</em> occasionally occurs in districts where lead mining is
the principal industry. The waste products of the mine thrown into streams
contaminate the water supply, so that the mineral is taken into the system
gradually, and a very small per cent of any of the salts taken into the system
in this way is pernicious. Water which contains any salt of lead to the extent
of more than one-tenth of a grain to the gallon is unfit to drink. Such water
when used continually is likely to produce colic from the resulting intestinal
irritation, and in aggravated cases paralysis more or less severe is likely to
be developed. A blue line on the margin of the gums, the last symptom, is
regarded as diagnostic and its presence as conclusive evidence of the nature of
the disorder.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment should first be directed toward removing the
cause. A large dose of purgative medicine should be given, and the brain
symptoms be relieved by giving bromid of potassium in half-ounce doses every 4
or 5 hours and by the application of cold water to the head. Dilute sulphuric
acid in half-ounce doses should be given with the purgative medicine. In this
case sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salt) is the best purgative, and it may be
given in doses of from 1 to 2 pounds dissolved in warm water. After the acute
symptoms have abated, iodid of potassium may be given, in doses of 2 drams
each, three times a day for a week.</p>

<p>No treatment is likely to be of avail until the cause is removed.</p>

<h5>COPPER POISONING.</h5>

<p>The soluble salts of copper, though used as a tonic in the medicinal
treatment of cattle, are poisonous when taken in large quantities. Like lead
and arsenic, they have an irritant effect upon the mucous membrane with which
they come in contact in a concentrated form. Cattle are not very likely to be
poisoned from this cause unless through carelessness. Sulphate of copper,
commonly called blue vitriol, is occasionally used for disinfecting and
cleansing stables, where it might inadvertently be mixed with the feed. It is
also used largely for making the Bordeaux mixture used in spraying fruit trees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
The general symptoms produced are those of intestinal irritation, short breathing,
stamping, and tender abdomen.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give powdered iron, or iron reduced by hydrogen, or
calcined magnesia. Sulphur may be used. This should be followed by a liberal
supply of demulcents, linseed infusion, boiled starch, whites of eggs, etc.</p>

<h5>ZINC POISONING.</h5>

<p>Several of the soluble salts of zinc are irritant poisons. The chlorid and
sulphate are those in most common use. In animals which have power to vomit
they are emetic in their action. In others, when retained in the stomach, they
set up more or less irritation of the mucous membrane and abdominal pain,
producing symptoms already described in the action of other poisons which
produce the same result.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment should be the same as for copper
poisoning.</p>

<h5>PHOSPHORUS POISONING.</h5>

<p>Only one of the forms of phosphorus in common use&mdash;the ordinary
yellow&mdash;is poisonous. Phosphorus in this form is used for the destruction
of rats and mice and other vermin, and has been largely used in the manufacture
of matches.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are loss of appetite, colic, diarrhea,
irritation of the mouth and throat, and paralysis of the throat. There is also
weakness, difficult breathing, and rapid pulse. The course of the poisoning is
usually rapid, terminating in either recovery or death within three days. The
toxic dose for cattle is from 5 to 30 grains. If taken in large quantities the
excreta are occasionally noticed to be luminous when examined in the dark.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Turpentine is given in an emulsion with flaxseed tea in a
single dose of from 2 to 8 ounces. Permanganate of potassium may be given in a
one-fourth of 1 per cent solution. Stimulants, such as alcohol and ether,
should be administered. Oils and milk must not be given.</p>

<h5>MERCURY POISONING.</h5>

<p>Mercury poisoning is not rare in cattle from the fact that these animals
have a special susceptibility to the action of this substance. Antiseptic
washes or injections containing the bichlorid of mercury (corrosive sublimate)
must be used on cattle with great care. Mercurial disinfecting solutions or
salves must be used cautiously. Calomel can not be given freely to cattle.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are salivation, sore mouth, indigestion,
diarrhea, skin eruption, paralysis of local groups of muscles, and
nephritis.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment consists in administering sulphur in large
doses (2 to 4 ounces) or iron powder. Both make insoluble compounds with
mercury. Follow with the whites of eggs mixed with water and with linseed tea.
If the case does not terminate promptly, give iodid of potash in 1-dram doses
twice daily.</p>

<h4>POISONING BY ACIDS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mineral acids</span>.&mdash;The mineral
acids&mdash;nitric, sulphuric, hydrochloric, etc.&mdash; when used in a
concentrated form destroy the animal tissues with which they come in contact,
and in this respect differ from most of the poisons previously described. When
taken into the stomach the mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus,
and stomach is apt to be more or less completely destroyed. If taken in large
quantities death is likely to result so speedily that nothing can be done to
relieve the patient, and even if time is allowed and the action of the acid can
be arrested it can not be done until considerable and, perhaps, irreparable
damage has been done. The mucous membrane with which the acid has come in
contact in the esophagus may be destroyed by its corrosive action and carried
away, leaving the muscular tissues exposed. The raw surface heals irregularly,
the cicatrice contracting causes stricture, and an animal so injured is likely
to die of starvation. In the stomach even greater damage is likely to be done.
The peristaltic action of the esophagus carries the irritant along quickly, but
here it remains quiet in contact with one surface, destroying it. It is likely
to perforate the organ and, coming in contact with the abdominal lining or
other organs of digestion, soon sets up a condition that is beyond repair. In a
less concentrated form, when this is not sufficiently strong to be corrosive,
it exerts an irritant effect. In this form it may not do much harm unless taken
in considerable quantity. When thus the mucous membrane of the stomach and
intestines becomes inflamed pain and diarrhea are likely to result.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Any of the alkalies may be used as an antidote. Most
convenient of these are chalk, baking soda, marble dust, magnesia, lime, soap,
or plaster from a wall. Mucilaginous drinks should be given in large
quantities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetable acids</span>.&mdash;Oxalic acid in particular
is corrosive in its action when taken in concentrated solution, losing its
corrosive effect and becoming irritant when more dilute. It also exerts a
specific effect on the heart, frequently causing death from syncope. Taken in
the form either of the crystals or solution it is likely to cause death in a
very short time. Failure of heart action and the attendant small pulse,
weakness, staggering, and convulsions are the more noticeable symptoms. Acetic
acid is irritant to the gastrointestinal tract, and may cause sudden paralysis
of the heart.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The action of the acid should be counteracted by the use of
alkalies, as advised above, by limewater or lime or plaster given promptly, by
protectives to the digestive tract, and by stimulants.</p>

<h4>POISONING BY ALKALIES.</h4>

<p>The carbonates of potash and soda and the alkalies themselves in
concentrated form cause symptoms of intestinal irritation similar to those
produced by mineral acids. Ammonia, caustic soda, and caustic potash (lye) are
those to which animals are most exposed. The degree of their caustic irritant
effects depends on their degree of concentration. When they reach the stomach
the symptoms are nearly as well marked as in the case of the acids. The
irritation is even more noticeable, and purgation is likely to be a more
prominent symptom. If death is not caused soon, the irritation of the
gastrointestinal tract and malnutrition will last for a long time.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in neutralizing the alkali by an acid,
such as dilute sulphuric acid (1 per cent) or strong vinegar. The
administration of such an antidote and its action must be carefully watched
during administration. In the chemical change which takes place when the acid
and alkali are combined, carbonic-acid gas is liberated, which may be to an
extent sufficient to cause considerable distention of the abdomen, and even to
produce asphyxia from pressure forward on the diaphragm. Should this danger
present itself, it may be averted by opening the flank, permitting the gas to
escape. (See "Acute tympanites, or Bloating," <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>.) Flaxseed or slippery-elm
decoction must be given to sooth the inflamed mucous surface. Opium may be used
to allay pain.</p>

<h4>COAL-OIL POISONING.</h4>

<p>Coal oil is sometimes administered empirically as a treatment for intestinal
parasites. If given in large doses it produces poisonous effects, which are
likely to be manifested some time after the administration. It acts as an
irritant to the digestive tract, causing dribbling of ropy saliva from the
mouth, diarrhea, tenesmus, and loss of appetite, with increased temperature and
cold extremities. Visible mucous membranes are injected, pupils of the eyes are
contracted, and there is a watery discharge from the eyes and nostrils.
Remotely it exerts a depressing influence on the functions of the brain and
slight coma, and occasionally convulsions, from which the animal is easily
aroused. The kidneys also suffer. The urine is dark colored and has the
characteristic odor of coal oil. Death may result from gastroenteritis or
convulsions.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The patient's strength should be fostered by the frequent
administration of mild stimulants, of which aromatic spirits of ammonia is perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
best. The animal should be encouraged to eat soft feed and given mucilaginous
drinks.</p>

<p>Crude coal oil is sometimes applied to the skin to kill parasites. If too
much is used, especially in hot weather, great weakness and depression may be
caused and in some cases death may result.</p>

<h4>CARBOLIC-ACID POISONING.</h4>

<p>Although one of the most valuable antiseptic remedies, carbolic acid in a
concentrated form, when taken internally or used over a large surface
externally, is likely to produce poisonous effects. It causes whitening,
shrinking, and numbness of the structures with which it comes in contact, and,
besides its irritant effect, exerts a powerful influence on the nervous system.
Being readily absorbed, it produces its effect whether swallowed, injected into
the rectum, inhaled, or applied to wounds, or even to a large tract of unbroken
skin. Used extensively as a dressing, it may produce nausea, dizziness, and
smoky or blackish colored urine. The last symptom is nearly always noticeable
where the poisonous effect is produced. In more concentrated form, or used in
larger quantities, convulsions, followed by fatal coma, are likely to take
place. Even in smaller quantities, dullness, trembling, and disinclination for
food often continue for several days. In a tolerably concentrated solution it
coagulates albumen and acts as an astringent.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;As an antidote internally, a solution of sulphate of soda
or sulphate of magnesia (Glauber's or Epsom salt) may be given. The white of
egg is also useful. Stimulants may be given if needed. When the poisoning
occurs through too extensive applications to wounds or the skin, as in
treatment of mange, cold water should be freely applied so as to wash off any
of the acid that may still remain unabsorbed. As a surgical dressing a 3 per
cent solution is strong enough for ordinary purposes. Water will not hold more
than 5 per cent in permanent solution. No preparation stronger than the
saturated solution should be used medicinally under any circumstances.</p>

<h4>SALTPETER POISONING.</h4>

<p>Both nitrate of soda and nitrate of potassium are poisonous to cattle. These
substances are used for manure and for preserving meats. They may be
administered in a drench by error in place of Glauber's salt, or they may be
exposed within reach of cattle and thus be eaten. The toxic dose depends upon
the condition of fullness of the stomach. If in solution and given on an empty
stomach, as little as 3 ounces of saltpeter (nitrate of potassium) may be fatal
to a cow. More of the Chile saltpeter (nitrate of soda) is required to
cause serious trouble.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Severe gastroenteritis, colic, tympanites, diarrhea,
excessive urination, weakness, trembling, convulsions, collapse.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Same as for poisoning by common salt.</p>

<h4>POISONING BY COMMON SALT.</h4>

<p>A few pounds (3 to 5) of common salt will produce well-marked signs of
poisoning in cattle. So much salt as this will not be taken by cattle except
under unusual conditions. If the feed is poor in salt, and if no salt has been
given for a long time, an intense "salt hunger" may occur that may lead an
animal to eat a poisonous quantity, or an overdose of salt may be given by
error as a drench. In order to prevent overeating of salt, it is doubtless
better in salting cattle to use rock salt rather than that in more or less
finely divided form.</p>

<p>Herring and mackerel brine and pork pickle are also poisonous, and are
especially dangerous for hogs. In these substances there are, in addition to
salt, certain products extracted from the fish or meat which undergo change and
add to the toxicity of the solution. Sometimes saltpeter is present in such
brines.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are great thirst, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
poor appetite, redness and dryness of the mouth, increased urination, paralysis
of the hind legs, weak pulse, general paralysis, coma, and death in from six to
eight hours.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Allow as much warm water as the animal will drink; give
protectives, such as linseed tea, etc. Linseed or olive oil may be given. To
keep up the heart action give ether, alcohol, camphor, digitalis, or coffee. To
allay pain, give opium.</p>

<h4>VEGETABLE POISONS.</h4>

<p>Vegetable poisons may be divided into two classes&mdash;those that are
likely to be administered to the animal as medicine, and such as may be taken
in the feed, either in the shape of poisonous plants or as plants or feeds of
vegetable origin that have been damaged by fungi or by bacteria which have
produced fermentation or putrefaction.</p>

<h4>VEGETABLE POISONS USED AS MEDICINE.</h4>

<h5>OPIUM (MORPHIN, LAUDANUM) POISONING.</h5>

<p>Opium and its alkaloid, morphia, are so commonly used in the practice of
medicine that the poisonous result of an overdose is not uncommon. The common
preparations are gum opium, the inspissated juice of the poppy; powdered opium,
made from the gum; tincture of opium, commonly called laudanum; and the
alkaloid or active principle, morphia. Laudanum has about one-eighth the
strength of the gum or powder. Morphia is present in good opium to the extent
of about 10 per cent. In medicine it is a most useful agent in allaying pain.
It first produces a stimulating action, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"
 id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> which is followed by drowsiness, a
disposition to sleep or complete anesthesia, depending on the quantity of the
drug used. In poisonous doses a state of exhilaration is well marked at first.
This is particularly noticeable in cattle and in horses. The animal becomes
much excited, and this stage does not pass into insensibility unless an
enormous dose has been given. If the dose is large enough, a second stage
sometimes supervenes, in which the symptoms are those of congestion of the
brain. The visible membranes have a bluish tint (cyanotic) from interference
with the air supply. The breathing is slow, labored, and later stertorous; the
pupils of the eyes are very much contracted; the skin dry and warm. Gas
accumulates in the stomach, so that tympanites is a prominent symptom. The
patient may be aroused by great noise or the infliction of sharp pain, when the
breathing becomes more natural. A lapse into the comatose condition takes place
when the excitement ceases. Later, there is perfect coma and the patient can no
longer be aroused from the insensible condition. The contraction of the pupil
becomes more marked, the breathing intermittent and slower, there is
perspiration, the pulse more feeble and rapid, till death takes place.
Poisoning of cattle with opium or its products rarely goes beyond the stage of
excitement, because the quantity of the drug required for the later effects is
so great. Seventy-five grains of morphia administered subcutaneously has
sufficed merely to excite for 12 hours.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give strong coffee, 1 to 4 quarts, aromatic spirits of
ammonia or carbonate of ammonia. Atropia is the physiological antidote.</p>

<h5>STRYCHNIN POISONING.</h5>

<p>Strychnin is a very concentrated poison and produces its effect very
quickly, usually only a few minutes being necessary if given in sufficient dose
and in such a way that it will be at once absorbed. When employed as a
medicine, as a rule, minimum doses should be used, as cattle are quite
susceptible to its effects and may be killed by the maximum doses given in the
common manuals of veterinary medicine. The first noticeable symptom is evidence
of unrest or mental excitement; at the same time the muscles over the shoulder
and croup may be seen to quiver or twitch, and later there occurs a more or
less well-marked convulsion; the head is jerked back, the back arched and leg
extended, the eyes drawn. The spasm continues for only a few minutes, when it
relaxes and another occurs in a short time. The return is hastened by
excitement and in a short time again disappears, continuing to disappear and
reappear until death results. As the poisonous effect advances the intervals
between the spasms become shorter and less marked and the spasms more severe
until the animal dies in violent struggles.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The best method is to put the patient under the influence
of chloral, chloroform, or ether, and keep it there continuously until the
effect of the poison has passed off. Alcohol may be given in large doses.</p>

<h5>ACONITE POISONING.</h5>

<p>In recent years tincture of aconite has become a popular stable remedy. If
an animal is ailing, aconite is given whether indicated or not. Fortunately the
dose used is generally small, and for this reason the damage done is much less
than it would otherwise be. Aconite is one of the most deadly poisons known. It
produces paralysis of motion and sensation, depresses the heart's action, and
causes death by paralysis of respiration. In large doses it causes profuse
salivation, champing of the jaws, and attempts at swallowing. If not sufficient
to cause death, there is impaired appetite with more or less nausea for some
time after. In poisonous doses it causes the animal to tremble violently, to
lose power to support itself, and brings on slight convulsions, with
perspiration. The pulse is depressed, irregular, and afterwards
intermittent.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The chemical antidote is tannic acid, which forms an
insoluble compound with the aconitin. The depressing effect on the heart should
be counteracted by the use of ammonia, digitalis, alcohol, camphor, or other
diffusible stimulants, which have a physiological effect opposite to
aconite.</p>

<h4>POISONOUS PLANTS.</h4>

<p>An important group of poisons may be classed under this head. In most cases
it is poison naturally belonging in the plant; in other cases the poisonous
principle is developed in what would otherwise be harmless plants as a plant
disease, or as a fermentation or putrefaction due to bacterial growth and
observed in forage, grain, or meal that has become heated, damaged, or
"spoilt."</p>

<p>The subject of poisonous plants is an important one and is of especial
interest to those using the western stock ranges, for it is probable that there
is no other single cause producing so many fatalities. In this article only a
few of the more important plants are treated in a brief way, for an extended
treatise would be necessary if the subject were to be handled adequately.
Further information should be sought in the more elaborate publications. Many
of the American poisonous plants have been treated in bulletins issued by the
United States Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em> for plant poisoning.&mdash;Remedies given by the mouth in most
cases fail to give relief to cattle affected by poisonous plants. The material
of the poisonous plants in the first stomach is not very largely affected by a
remedy given as a drench. If any beneficial result is effected, it must be<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> on the
material which has already passed into the fourth stomach, so that to get any
real antidotal result the remedy must be given repeatedly in order to meet the
alkaloid poisons as they are passing through the fourth stomach. While certain
substances like tannic acid and potassium permanganate are the logical
antidotes for plant poisons, in practical application they are very
disappointing in the treatment of ruminant animals. Reliance must be mainly on
prevention and upon such remedies as will increase elimination. A laxative or
purgative is always helpful, and for this purpose Epsom salt may be given in
pound doses, or linseed oil in doses of 1 or 2 pints. In some few cases special
remedies can be given as is indicated below.</p>

<p>It is well to bear in mind that cattle while grazing freely in good pasture
are not likely to eat poisonous plants to any extent. If these same plants are
gathered and thrown in a pile, the animals, through a kind of pernicious
curiosity, may eat them with disastrous results. This has frequently happened
when freshly cut branches of cherry, yew, oleander, and other plants have been
thrown where dairy cattle could get at them.</p>

<h5>OAKS.</h5>

<p>The foliage of oaks is a valuable constituent of the forage on many ranges
and pastures. It has been shown, however, that when this is eaten without some
admixture of other food, cattle frequently sicken and die. Many cases of the
poisoning of cattle by acorns have been reported in England and Germany, and
there have been some complaints in the United States. Harmful results from
eating acorns do not seem likely to occur except as they are eaten in
considerable quantities.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of oak poisoning are constipation, mucus and
blood in the feces, emaciation, and edema. The symptoms of acorn poisoning are
much the same.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Change of pasture or an addition of other food material.</p>

<h5>HORSE CHESTNUT&mdash;BUCKEYE.</h5>

<p>All the species of <em>&AElig;sculus</em>, popularly known as horse chestnut or buckeye,
are considered poisonous. The bark, leaves, and fruit are injurious. It is said
that if the fruit is boiled or roasted and washed out it becomes harmless and
even is a desirable addition to the feed of cattle. The Indians in time of
scarcity of food have used the fruit after preparing it in this way. The
buckeyes are said to have a specific effect in producing abortion in cattle and
goats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h5>DEATH CAMAS (SPECIES OF ZYGADENUS).</h5>

<p>The death-camas plants, which are commonly known in the Pacific States as
"lobelia," are especially destructive of sheep, but cattle sometimes eat them
and are poisoned. Cases of cattle poisoning are not likely to result
fatally.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are salivation, nausea accompanied by vomiting,
great weakness, and lowered temperature.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;There is no effective treatment for death-camas
poisoning.</p>

<h5>FLY POISON (CHROSPERMA MUSCÃTORIUM).</h5>

<p>This plant, which is closely related to the death-camas plants, is sometimes
known as "stagger grass" and causes a considerable loss in the Southern States.
It grows earlier than the grasses, and on this account is more likely to be
eaten. Like death camas, it produces pronounced nausea, resulting in vomiting
and weakness, and in cases which recover the effects may continue for several
days. Apparently the injurious effects are more common in the case of cattle
than in other domestic animals. There is no known way of treating these
animals, though doubtless purgatives would be beneficial.</p>

<h5>YEW (TAXUS BACCATA).</h5>

<p>The European yew has long been known as a very poisonous plant. It is
cultivated in America, and while cases of poisoning have not been common, it is
well to recognize its dangerous character. A comparatively small dose is
poisonous and ordinarily acts with great rapidity. It causes respiratory
paralysis and the animal dies in convulsions.</p>

<h5>LAUREL.</h5>

<p>The laurels, including the broad-leafed laurel, <em>Kalmia latifolia</em>, the
narrow-leafed laurel, <em>Kalmia angustifolia</em>, the rhododendrons, and other closely
related plants are poisonous and cause considerable losses. It is dangerous to
let cattle graze where these plants are abundant at times when other forage is
scarce. The symptoms are salivation, nausea and vomiting, spasms, dizziness,
stupor, and death.</p>

<h5>FERN.</h5>

<p>The common brake or bracken fern, <em>Pteris aquilina</em>, has been considered
responsible for the poisoning of many horses and cattle. Many cases have been
reported in England and Germany, and some well-authenticated cases in the
United States. Very little has been learned experimentally of fern poisoning,
but there seems to be little question that it has been the cause of many
deaths. The symptoms <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a>
</span>are said to be temperature higher than normal, loss of
appetite, bloody discharges from mouth, nose, and bowels, and great depression
followed by coma and death. Some authors say that the urine is colored by
blood. It is thought by some that the disease known as "red water" in the
northwestern United States and Canada is caused by eating ferns.</p>

<h5>SORGHUM POISONING.</h5>

<p>Under certain conditions sorghum contains enough hydrocyanic acid to make it
exceedingly dangerous to cattle. These cases of poisoning most commonly occur
when cattle are pastured upon the young plant or upon a field where the crop
has been cut and is making a second growth. Conditions of drought make the
sorghum especially dangerous. There is some reason to think that the frosted
second growth is particularly rich in hydrocyanic acid. The cases of poisoning
occur when animals are grazed upon the plant, but not from the harvested crop
or from silage. If cattle are grazed on sorghum or sorghum stubble they should
at first be under constant observation and should be removed as soon as any
signs of illness appear. Similar precautions should be used in grazing
kafir.</p>

<h5>CORNSTALK DISEASE.</h5>

<p>Considerable losses of cattle have occurred when they were turned upon
cornfields in the fall. Deaths come very suddenly and there is no opportunity
to apply remedies. It has been thought that these fatalities, like those from
sorghum, were caused by hydrocyanic acid, but there is good reason to think
that this is not true, and at the present time there is no accepted explanation
of this disease, although there seems to be no doubt that it is connected in
some way with the condition of the corn. Whether a given field is poisonous or
not can only be determined by experiment, and the wise farmer will keep his
cattle under close observation when they are first turned into a cornfield.</p>

<h5>WATER HEMLOCK (CICUTA).</h5>

<p>This plant, growing in wet places by ditches and along creeks, is the most
poisonous of North American plants. The root is the poisonous part, and cattle
generally get it when it is plowed up or washed out by high water. Sometimes
they pull it up, for the plant occasionally grows out into ditches so that the
whole plant will be taken in grazing. The most marked symptoms of Cicuta
poisoning are the violent convulsions, which remind one of the effect of
strychnin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
67]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Little can be done in the way of treatment. The logical
thing is to attempt to control the convulsions by means of morphia, but in view
of the fact that the stomach can not be emptied, the prognosis is not good, and
most cases die.</p>

<h5>LARKSPURS.</h5>

<p>The larkspurs are a source of heavy loss to cattle owners in the higher
ranges of the West. There are a number of species, growing at altitudes from
4,000 feet to timber line, and all are poisonous. A few cases of poisoning by
larkspurs have been reported in the eastern United States, but most of the
losses are confined to the West, both because larkspurs grow there in greater
profusion and because cattle are grazed in that region on the open ranges. The
losses are confined to cattle, for sheep and horses can graze on larkspur with
no resulting harm. Most of the larkspur losses occur in the spring and early
summer, as the plants lose their toxicity after maturing.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Larkspur poisoning is accompanied by a definite line of
symptoms. In range animals the first symptom noted is generally the sudden
falling of the animal and consequent inability to rise. After a while it may
rise, only to fall again. This may happen repeatedly. In severe cases the
animal lies prone and exhibits nausea, accompanied by vomiting. It dies of
respiratory paralysis, death many times being hastened by the asphyxia
following the vomiting.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The animal, if found down, should be turned so that its
head is uphill in order to relieve the lungs. Many cases will recover with no
further treatment. Nearly all cases will recover if a hypodermic injection is
given immediately of physostigmin salicylate 1 grain, pilocarpin hydrochlorid 2
grains, strychnin sulphate &frac12; grain.</p>

<h5>LOCO.</h5>

<p>The loco plants have caused especially heavy losses of cattle, horses, and
sheep. They grow in the semiarid regions of the West and sometimes in great
luxuriance. The best known are the "blue loco," the "woolly loco" or "purple
loco," and the "white loco" or "rattle-weed." The blue loco is common in parts
of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. It affects both horses and cattle. The purple
loco, <em>Astragalus mollissimus</em>, is common in Texas and the adjoining States and
extends north as far as Nebraska and Colorado. It is especially destructive to
horses. The white loco, <em>Oxytropis lamberti</em>, is still more widely distributed,
being found in the plains region from Alaska to Mexico and west of the Rocky
Mountains to central Utah. The white loco is much more important than the
purple loco, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
68]</a></span> affects not only horses but cattle and sheep. These plants
belong to the pea family, and there are a number of other species of this
family that are loco plants and produce the same symptoms.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Loco poisoning is a chronic condition and symptoms are shown
only after somewhat prolonged feeding. The condition is one of cumulative
poisoning, and animals sometimes decline very rapidly after the first symptoms
appear. In many cases animals acquire a habit of eating loco and prefer it to
any other feed. The poison affects the central nervous system. There is a lack
of muscular coordination and the animal performs very erratic movements. In the
later stages the animal becomes emaciated and eventually dies of starvation.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Locoed animals are badly constipated, and it is important
that this condition should be remedied at the start. Any purgative can be used,
but Epsom salt has been found especially effective. If locoed animals can be
turned into a field of alfalfa, a large proportion of them will recover with no
further treatment. Recovery may be aided by giving cattle, hypodermically,
daily doses of three-twentieths to four-twentieths of a grain of strychnin. By
this treatment cattle can be cured and put in condition for market.</p>

<h5>WHITE SNAKEROOT (EUPATORIUM URTICÃFOLIUM).</h5>

<p>White snakeroot, frequently known as "rich weed," is a plant growing in
great abundance in some of the eastern and central regions of the United
States. It is particularly abundant in parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,
and in western North Carolina. It is responsible for most, if not all, of the
cases of a disease which is commonly known as "milk sickness."</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The animals are constipated, sometimes have bloody feces,
become weak, and exhibit muscular trembling. This trembling is very
characteristic, so that the disease is sometimes known as "the trembles."</p>

<p><em>Remedy</em>.&mdash;There are no remedies which will work very efficiently. It is
desirable to give the animals purgatives like Epsom salt and, of course, to
remove them from fields where this plant is abundant.</p>

<h5>RAYLESS GOLDENROD (ISOCOMA WRIGHTII).</h5>

<p>The rayless goldenrod is a plant growing in especial abundance in parts of
the Pecos Valley in New Mexico and Arizona, and there produces a disease so
much like that produced in the East by white snakeroot that it is sometimes
called milk sickness. More generally this disease goes under the name of
"alkali disease." The plant has produced heavy losses in the regions where it
grows abundantly.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are much like those produced by the white
snakeroot. The animals are constipated, sometimes have <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>bloody feces, become
weak, and exhibit muscular trembling. There is good reason to think, too, that
the milk of cows eating this plant is more or less injurious.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A purgative like Epsom salt will aid an animal in
recovering, but most important is to remove the cattle from pastures where the
plant is abundant and give them an abundance of good forage. Under such
conditions they are almost certain to recover.</p>

<h5>MILKWEEDS.</h5>

<p>Many of the milkweeds have long been known to have more or less poisonous
properties. Within the last few years it has been discovered that certain of
the milkweeds going under the popular name of whorled milkweeds are especially
toxic. There are at least four species of whorled milkweeds, but two of them
are particularly important from the standpoint of people handling livestock.
One, known scientifically as <em>Asclepias galioides</em>, is harmful in Colorado, Utah,
Arizona, and New Mexico, while another, known as <em>Asclepias mexicana</em>, has
produced losses, especially in California and Nevada. These whorled milkweeds
are distasteful to all animals and are eaten only when the stock is closely
confined to pastures where there is little else in the way of forage.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The most prominent symptoms are weakness, producing
staggering, and this is followed in acute cases by violent spasms.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;There is no treatment which will effectively antidote the
effect of the poison. In practically all cases, however, poisoning may be
avoided if care is taken to prevent animals from being closely confined where
this plant is abundant, as they never eat the plant by choice.</p>

<h5>CHERRY.</h5>

<p>In the leaves of the cherries more or less hydrocyanic acid is produced, and
when these leaves are eaten in any considerable quantity cases of poisoning are
likely to arise. It is popularly supposed that these cases arise from eating
wilted cherry leaves, but there is every reason to think that the fresh leaves
will produce the same results. These cases are easily prevented, because no
harm results from eating a small quantity of the leaves, and if the fact is
recognized that poisoning may result from eating a large quantity, it is not
difficult to care for the animals so as to prevent poisoning.</p>

<h5>ERGOTISM.</h5>

<p>The poisonous effects of ergot
(<a href="#PLATE_V">Pls.&nbsp;V</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#PLATE_VI">VI</a>)
appear chiefly in the winter and spring of the year and among cattle. It is
developed among grasses grown on rich soil in hot, damp seasons. Rye seems
more liable to ergot than any of our other crops. Of the grasses <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>which enter into the
composition of hay, bluegrass is the most likely to become affected. Ergot
may also affect redtop, oats, grasses, and grains. On the plant the fungus
manifests itself on the seeds, where it is easily recognized when the hay is
examined in the mow. The ergotized seeds are several times larger than the
natural seeds&mdash;hard, black, and generally curved in shape.</p>

<p>The effect of the protracted use of ergot in the feed is pretty well
understood to be that of producing a degeneration and obstruction of the
smaller arterial branches. The result is to shut off the blood supply to the
distal parts of the body, where the circulation is weakest, and thus to produce
a mummification or dry gangrene of the extremities, as the ears, tail, feet,
etc. Cattle seem to be more susceptible than other animals to the influence of
ergot, possibly on account of the slowness of the heart's action. When the
effect of the poison has become sufficient to entirely arrest the circulation
in any part, the structures soon die. The disorder manifests itself as lameness
in one or more limbs; swelling about the ankle which may result in only a small
slough or the loss of a toe, but it may circumscribe the limb at any point
below the knee or hock by an indented ring below which the tissues become dead.
The indentation soon changes to a crack, which extends completely around the
limb, forming the line of separation between the dead and living structures.
The crack deepens till the parts below drop off without loss of blood, and
frequently with very little pus. Ergot may cause serious irritation of the
digestive tract, or by acting upon the nervous system it may cause lethargy or
paralysis. It also operates to cause contraction of the uterus, and may thus
cause abortion.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Regarding the treatment, change of feed and local
antiseptics are, of course, indicated. The former may be useful as a
preventive, but when the symptoms have appeared the animal is necessarily so
completely saturated that recovery is likely to be tedious. Tannin may be given
internally in doses of one-half dram twice daily for a few days to neutralize
the unabsorbed alkaloids of the ergot. At the same time give castor oil. To
dilate the blood vessels give chloral hydrate. Bathe the affected parts with
hot water. If sloughing has gone far, amputation must be resorted to.</p>

<h5>OTHER POISONOUS FUNGI.</h5>

<p>Many other fungi poison herbivora. In some instances, however, where fungi
are blamed for causing disease their presence on the feedstuff or herbage is
but coincidental with some other and more potent disease-producing factor. For
example, if the conditions are favorable to the growth of fungi they are also
favorable to the growth of bacteria, and bacteria may produce poisons in feeds.
In general it may be said that any feed that is moldy, musty, or putrid <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>is possibly
dangerous. Silage, properly cured, does not belong to this class, because the
curing of silage is not a bacterial process. But spoiled silage and silage
matted with mold is dangerous and should not be fed.</p>

<h4>POISONING BY ANIMAL PRODUCTS.</h4>

<h5>SNAKE BITES.</h5>

<p>The poison contained in the tooth glands of certain venomous reptiles,
particularly some of the snakes, which is injected into or under the skin of an
animal bitten by the reptile, is a very powerful agent. It is likely to produce
a serious local irritation, and in the case of the more poisonous snakes
serious constitutional disturbances, even to causing death, which it may do in
either of two ways: First, when very strong, by exerting a narcotic influence
similar to that of some of the powerful poisons, checking heart action. Second,
by diffused inflammation of the areolar tissue, gangrene, and extensive
sloughing.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of snake bite are a local swelling caused by an
intense local inflammation, pricks showing where the fangs penetrated,
depression, weakness, feeble pulse, difficult breathing, bluish discoloration
of the visible mucous membranes, stupor, or convulsions. If the poison is not
powerful or plentiful enough to produce death, it is, at any rate, likely to
cause severe local abscesses or sloughs.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment may be divided into local and general.
Locally every effort should be made to prevent absorption of the poison. If
discovered at once the bitten part had better be excised. If that is
impracticable and a ligature can be applied, as in the case of a bite to one of
the limbs, no time should be lost in applying it above the injury. It should be
made sufficiently tight to so far as possible arrest circulation in the bitten
part. The wound should be freely incised, so that it will bleed freely, and the
poison should be extracted by cupping, or pressed out by squeezing with the
fingers. Permanganate of potassium in 5 per cent solution should be applied to
and injected into the wound. The depressing effect of the poison on the general
system should be counteracted by hypodermic injections of strychnin, or by
liberal drenching with stimulants, such as coffee, digitalis, or the aromatic
spirits or carbonate of ammonia. In animal practice the alcoholic stimulants
and local treatment above described are likely to meet with best success. A
special antitoxin for use in treating snake bite is now prepared and may be had
from the leading druggists. It is quite effective if used promptly.</p>

<h5>WASP AND BEE STINGS.</h5>

<p>Wasps and bees secrete a poisonous substance which they are able to insert
through the skin of an animal by the aid of their sharp <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>stings. This poison
is a severe local irritant and may even cause local gangrene. It also has a
depressing effect upon the central nervous system and destroys the red-blood
corpuscles. To produce these general effects it must be introduced in very
large quantities, as when an animal is stung by a swarm of bees or wasps.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment is to wash the parts with diluted ammonia or
permanganate of potassium solution and to give stimulants internally. If there
is so much swelling about the head and nostrils as to interfere with breathing,
tracheotomy may be necessary.</p>

<h5>POISONING WITH SPANISH FLY.</h5>

<p>Spanish fly, in the form of powdered cantharides, may be given in an
overdose, or when applied as a blister to too large a surface of skin enough
may be absorbed to poison. If given by the mouth, it causes severe irritation
of the gastrointestinal tract, shown by salivation, sore throat, colic, bloody
diarrhea, etc. It also produces, whether given by the mouth or absorbed through
the skin, irritation of the urinary tract, as shown by frequent and painful
urination. If death results, it is due to respiratory paralysis.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give protectives and the white of egg, with opium. Do not
give oils or alcohol.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_HEART_BLOOD_VESSELS_AND"
id="DISEASES_OF_THE_HEART_BLOOD_VESSELS_AND"></a>DISEASES OF THE HEART, BLOOD
VESSELS, AND LYMPHATICS.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">W. H. Harbaugh, V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]</h5>

<h4>THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>In cattle, as in human beings, the heart, blood vessels, and lymphatics may
be described as the circulatory apparatus.</p>

<p>The heart is in the thoracic cavity (chest). It is conical in form, with the
base or large part uppermost, while the apex, or point, rests just above the
sternum (breastbone). It is situated between the right and left lungs, the apex
inclining to the left, and owing to this the heart beats are best felt on the
left side of the chest, behind the elbow. The heart may be considered as a
hollow muscle, containing four compartments, two on each side. The upper
compartments are called auricles and the lower ones ventricles. The right
auricle and ventricle are completely separated from the left auricle and
ventricle by a thick septum or wall, so that there is no communication between
the right and left sides of the organ.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each auricle is the auriculo-ventricular opening, each
provided with a valve to close it when the heart contracts to force the blood
into the arteries. In the interval between the contractions these valves hang
down into the ventricles.</p>

<p>The muscular tissue of the heart belongs to that class known as involuntary,
because its action is not controlled by the will.</p>

<p>The cavities of the heart are lined by a serous membrane, called the
endocardium, which may be considered as a continuation of the veins and the
arteries, forming their internal lining. The walls of the ventricles are
thicker than those of the auricles, and the walls of the left ventricle are
much thicker than those of the right.</p>

<p>The heart is enveloped by a fibrous sac (or bag), called the pericardium,
which assumes much of the general shape of the outer surface of the heart.</p>

<p>The action of the heart is similar to that of a pump and its function is to
keep the blood in circulation. The auricles may be considered as the reservoirs
or receivers of the blood and the ventricles as the pump chambers. During the
interval between contractions, the heart being in momentary repose, the blood
pours into the auricles from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">
[Pg 74]</a></span>veins; the auriculo-ventricular orifices being widely open,
the ventricles also receive blood; the auricles contract and the ventricles are
filled; contraction of the ventricles follows; the auriculo-ventricular valves
are forced up by the pressure of the blood and close the auriculo-ventricular
openings and prevent the return of blood into the auricles; the contraction
of the ventricles forces the blood from the right ventricle into the lungs
through the pulmonary artery and its branches, and from the left ventricle
into the aorta, thence through the arteries to all parts of the body. After
the contraction of the ventricles the heart is again in momentary repose and
is being filled with blood, while the valves in the aorta and pulmonary artery
close to prevent the return of blood into the ventricles.
(See <a href="#PLATE_VII">Pl. VII</a>.)</p>

<p>The average weight of the heart of an ox is said to be from 3&frac12; to 5
pounds; but, of course, owing to the many breeds and sizes of cattle, it must
vary in different animals.</p>

<p>The vessels that convey the blood from the heart to all parts of the body
are called arteries; those which return the blood to the heart are called
veins. The arteries divide and subdivide (like the branches of a tree), become
smaller and smaller, and ultimately ramify into every part of the body. Between
the ultimate ramifications of the arteries and the beginning of the veins there
is an intermediate system of very minute vessels called capillaries, which
connect the arterial with the venous system of the circulation. The walls of
the arteries are possessed of a certain amount of rigidity, sufficient to keep
the tubes open when they are empty.</p>

<p>The blood leaves the left ventricle through a single vessel, the common
aorta, consisting of the anterior and posterior aortas, which give off the
large arteries.</p>

<p>The veins take the blood from the capillaries in all parts of the body. They
begin in very small tubes, which unite to become larger in size and less in
number as they approach the heart.</p>

<p>In its course an artery is usually accompanied with a vein and in many
situations with a nerve. The more important arteries are placed deep within the
body; when they are superficial, however, they are generally found where least
exposed to injury, as, for example, on the inner side of the legs. Arteries are
less numerous than veins, and their total capacity is much less than that of
the veins. A great number of veins are in the tissue immediately beneath the
skin and do not generally accompany arteries.</p>

<p>The blood, throughout its course in the heart, arteries, capillaries, and
veins, is inclosed within these vessels. Except where the large lymphatics
empty into the venous blood, there is no opening into the course of the
blood.</p>

<p>All the arteries except the pulmonary and its branches carry bright-red
blood, and all the veins, except the pulmonary veins, <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>carry dark-red blood.
The impure dark-red blood is collected from the capillary vessels and carried
to the right auricle by the veins; it passes down into the right ventricle, and
thence into the pulmonary artery and through its branches to the capillaries of
the lungs, where the carbonic-acid gas and other impurities are given up to the
air in the air cells of the lungs (through the thin walls between the
capillaries and the air cells), and where it also absorbs from the air the
oxygen gas necessary to sustain life. This gas changes it to the bright-red,
pure blood. It passes from the capillaries to the branches of the pulmonary
veins, which convey it to the left auricle of the heart; it then passes through
the auriculo-ventricular opening into the left ventricle, the contraction of
which forces it through the common aorta into the posterior and anterior
aortas, and through all the arteries of the body into the capillaries, where it
parts with its oxygen and nutritive elements and where it absorbs carbonic-acid
gas and becomes dark colored. (See theoretical diagram of the circulation,
<a href="#PLATE_VII">Pl. VII</a>.)</p>

<p>The branches of certain arteries in different parts unite again after
subdividing. This reuniting is called anastomosing, and assures a quota of
blood to a part if one of the anastomosing arteries should be tied in case of
hemorrhage, or should be destroyed by accident or operation.</p>

<h4>THE BLOOD.</h4>

<p>The various kinds of food, after being digested in the alimentary canal, are
absorbed and carried into the blood by the lymphatics, and by the blood to the
places where nutrition is required. The blood takes from all parts of the body
all that is no longer required, and carries it to the different organs through
which it is eliminated from the body. It contains within itself all the
elements which nourish the body.</p>

<p>The blood may be considered as a fluid holding in solution certain inorganic
elements and having certain bodies suspended in it. To facilitate description,
the blood may be considered as made up of the corpuscles and the liquor
sanguinis. The corpuscles are of two kinds, the red and the white, the red
being the more numerous. The color of the blood is caused by the coloring
matter in the red corpuscles, which are the oxygen carriers. Both kinds are
very minute bodies, which require the aid of the microscope to recognize them.
The liquor sanguinis is composed of water containing in solution salts,
albumen, and the elements of fibrin.</p>

<p>The lymphatics, or absorbents, are the vessels which carry the lymph and
chyle in the blood. They begin as capillaries in all parts of the body,
gradually uniting to form larger trunks. Placed along the course of the
lymphatic vessels are glands, in some situations collected into groups; for
example, in the groin. These glands are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"
id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>often involved in inflammation arising from
the absorption of deleterious matter.</p>

<p>Absorption is the function of the lymphatics. The liquor sanguinis passes
from the blood capillaries to supply nutrition to the tissues. All of the
liquor sanguinis that is not required is absorbed by the lymphatic vessels and
conveyed back to the blood by the lymphatic ducts. The lymphatics which proceed
from the intestines convey the chyle into the blood during digestion. As a
rule, the lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins. All the absorbent
vessels convey their contents to the thoracic duct and right great lymphatic
vein, which empty into the anterior vena cava, where the lymph and chyle mix
with the venous blood, and thus maintain the supply of nutritive elements in
the blood.</p>

<h4>THE PULSE.</h4>

<p>As fully explained, the heart pumps the blood throughout the arterial
system. The arteries are always full and each contraction of the ventricle
pumps more blood into them; this distends their elastic walls and sends along
them a wave which gradually becomes less perceptible as it nears the very small
arteries. This wave constitutes the pulse, and is lost before the capillaries
are reached. The sensation or impression given to the finger when placed upon
the artery shows the force exerted by the heart and some important facts
concerning the condition of the circulation. In adult cattle the average number
of pulsations in a minute is from 50 to 60. The pulse is faster than normal
after exercise, excitement, on hot days, from pain, and as a result of fullness
of the stomach. In old animals it is slower than in the young and in males
slightly slower than in females. In fevers and inflammations and in local
diseases of the heart the pulse rate is increased. If the rate is greater than
100 or 110 to the minute the outlook for recovery is not good.</p>

<p>Other variations of the pulse are known as infrequent pulse, which means
that the number of pulsations in a given time is less than normal. The
irregular or the intermittent pulse is when the pulsations do not follow in
regular order. The large pulse and the small pulse refer to the volume of the
pulse, which may be larger or smaller than usual. The strong pulse and the
feeble pulse refer to the strength or weakness of the pulsation. The pulse is
said to be hard when the vessel feels hard and incompressible, the soft pulse
being the opposite. By dicrotic pulse is meant that kind of pulsation which
makes each beat seem double, and therefore it is generally called the double
pulse.</p>

<p>The venous or "jugular pulse" is the pulsation so frequently observed in the
jugular vein of cattle and is particularly noticeable while they are
ruminating&mdash;"chewing the cud." It is not always <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>associated with
disease, but may be a symptom of some disease of the heart; in such cases
the jugular pulse is continuous.</p>

<p>The place selected for feeling the pulse in cattle is where the submaxillary
artery winds around the lower jawbones, just at the lower edge of the flat
muscle on the side of the cheek; or, if the cow is lying down, the metacarpal
artery on the back part of the fore fetlock is very convenient for the
purpose.</p>

<h4>THE EXAMINATION OF THE HEART.</h4>

<p>Corresponding to the beats of the heart two sounds are emitted which are of
a definite type in healthy animals. The first is produced by the contraction of
the heart and the flow of blood out of it; the second is caused by the rebound
of blood in the aorta and the closure of the valves that prevent it from
flowing backward into the heart, whence it came. The first sound is the longer
and louder of the two, though of low pitch. The second sound is sharper and
shorter, and is not always easy to hear. There is a brief interval between
them.</p>

<p>To distinguish these sounds, the ear is placed against the left side of the
chest, a little above the point where the elbow rests when the animal is
standing in a natural position, and about opposite the sixth rib. Both heart
sounds are reduced in intensity when the animal is weak or when the heart is
forced away from the chest wall by collections of fluid or by tubercular or
other growths. Nonrhythmical heart sound is often caused by pericarditis or by
disease of the valves. It may also be attributable to overfilling of the heart
upon the right side, as occurs in severe congestion of the lungs and in some
febrile diseases.</p>

<p>In pericarditis, sounds like scraping, rubbing, or splashing may be heard,
entirely apart from the two normal sounds above described.</p>

<p>The impulse of the heart, as felt by placing the hand against the chest, is
of some consequence in reaching a conclusion in respect to disease of the
heart; but it must be remembered that the impulse may be very much increased by
diseases other than those of the heart, as, for example, inflammation of
various organs, severe pains, etc. The impulse may be increased also (when
disease does not exist) by work, exercise, fright, or any cause of excitement,
or, in general, by anything that causes acceleration of the pulse.</p>

<p>The impulse of the heart may be felt and the sounds may be heard fairly well
in lean cattle, but in fat ones it is difficult and often impossible to detect
either impulse or sound with any degree of satisfaction.</p>

<h4>PALPITATION.</h4>

<p>When the impulse of the heart is excessive&mdash;that is, when it beats more
or less tumultuously&mdash;the familiar expression "palpitation of <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>the heart" is
applied; by many it is called "thumps." The hand or ear placed against the
chest easily detects the unnatural beating. In some cases it is so violent that
the motion may be seen at a distance. Palpitation is but a symptom, and in many
instances not connected with disease of the structure of the heart or its
membranes. A badly frightened animal may have palpitation. When it comes on
suddenly and soon passes away, it depends on some cause other than diseases of
the heart; when it is gradually manifested, however, and becomes constant,
although more pronounced at one time than another, heart disease may be
suspected, especially if other symptoms of heart disease are present.</p>

<h4>INJURY TO THE HEART BY FOREIGN BODIES.</h4>

<p>Cattle are addicted to the habit of chewing and swallowing many objects not
intended as articles of food. Every veterinarian of experience has met with
instances to remind him of this, and it is well known to butchers. Among the
great variety of things that have thus found their way into the stomachs of
cattle the following have been noticed: Finger rings, knitting needles, old
shoes, table knives, wood, pieces of leather, pieces of wire, buttons,
hairpins, brushes, nails, coins, etc. The more sharply pointed objects
sometimes penetrate the wall of the stomach, in some cases causing gastric
irritation enough to produce indigestion, gradually work their way through the
diaphragm toward the heart, pierce the pericardium (bag inclosing the heart),
wound the heart, and thus prove fatal to the animal. Cases are recorded in
which the foreign body has actually worked its way into one of the cavities of
the heart. Instances are known, however, in which the object took a different
course, and finally worked its way toward the surface and was extracted from
the wall of the chest. While it is possible that the foreign body may pierce
the wall at different parts of the alimentary canal, as it frequently does that
of the rumen (paunch), it is thought that in most cases it passes through the
wall of the reticulum (smaller honeycombed compartment, or second stomach) and
is drawn toward the heart by the suctionlike action of the chest. Post-mortem
examinations have demonstrated the course it pursued, as adhesions and other
results of the inflammation it caused were plainly to be seen. All manner of
symptoms may precede those showing involvement of the heart, depending upon the
location of the foreign body and the extent of inflammation caused by it.
Severe indigestion may occur; stiffness and difficulty in moving about owing to
the prods of the sharp body following muscular contraction; pain on pressure
over the front, lower, or right side of the abdomen; coughing and difficult,
quick breathing. In most cases the foreign body does not penetrate to the
heart, nor even to the pericardium.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are as follows: The animal is disinclined to
move actively, the step is restricted and cautious, sudden motion causes
grunting, the attitude is constrained, the feet are drawn somewhat together,
the back is arched, the face has an anxious expression. If the disease is of
several days' standing, there is likely to be soft swelling (edema) beneath the
neck, in the dewlap, and under the chest, between the fore legs. Breathing is
short and difficult; it may clearly be painful. The pulse is rapid, 80 to 120
per minute. The muscles quiver as though the animal were cold. Rumination and
appetite are depressed or checked. The dung is hard, and to void it appears to
cause pain. These symptoms usually develop gradually, and, of course, they vary
considerably in different animals, depending upon the size and location of the
foreign body and the irritation it causes.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, in such cases treatment is useless, but when it is
possible to diagnose correctly the animal could be turned over to the butcher
before the flesh becomes unfit for use; that is, before there is more than a
little suppuration and before there is fever. Knowing that cattle are prone to
swallow such objects, ordinary care may be taken in keeping their surroundings
as free of them as possible.</p>

<h4>PERICARDITIS.</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the pericardium (heart bag) is often associated with
pneumonia and pleurisy, rheumatism, and other constitutional diseases, or with
an injury. It also occurs as an independent affection, owing to causes similar
to those of other chest affections, as exposure to cold or dampness and changes
of the weather.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;It may be ushered in with a chill, followed by fever, of
more or less severity; the animal stands still and dull, with head hanging low,
and anxiety expressed in its countenance. The pulse may be large, perhaps hard;
there is also a venous pulse. The hand against the chest will feel the beating
of the heart, which is often irregular, sometimes violent, and in other
instances weak, depending in part upon the quantity of fluid that has transuded
into the pericardial sac. The legs are cold, the breathing quickened and
usually abdominal; if the left side of the chest is pressed on or struck, the
animal evinces pain. There may be spasms of the muscles in the region of the
breast, neck, or hind legs. After a variable time swelling may also appear in
the legs and under the chest and brisket.</p>

<p>In those animals in which the heart sounds may be heard somewhat distinctly,
the ear applied against the chest will detect a to-and-fro friction sound,
corresponding to the beats of the heart. This sound is produced by the rubbing
of the internal surface of the heart bag <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"
id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>against the external surface of the
heart. During the first stages of the inflammation these surfaces are dry, and
the rubbing of one against the other during the contraction and relaxation of
the heart produces this sound. The dry stage is followed by the exudation of
fluid into the heart sac, and the friction is not heard until the fluid is
absorbed sufficiently to allow the surfaces to come in contact again. But
during the time the friction sound is lost a sound which has been called a
"churning noise" may take its place.</p>

<p>The friction sound of pericarditis can not be mistaken for the friction
sound of pleurisy if the examination is a careful one, because in the heart
affection the sound is made in connection with the heart beats, while in the
pleuritic affection the sound is synchronous with each respiration or breath of
air taken in and expelled from the lungs.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When pericarditis is complicated with rheumatism or other
diseases the latter must be treated as directed in the description of them. The
animal must be kept in a quiet, comfortable place, where it will be free from
excitement. Warm clothing should be applied to the body, and the legs should be
hand-rubbed until the circulation in them is reestablished, and then they
should be snugly bandaged. The food should be nutritive and in moderate
quantity. Bleeding should not be performed unless the case is in the hands of
an expert.</p>

<p>At the beginning give as a purgative Epsom salt&mdash;1 pound to an
average-sized cow&mdash;dissolved in about a quart of warm water and
administered as a drench. When there is much pain 2 ounces of laudanum, diluted
with a pint of water, may be given every three hours until the animal is
better. Do not give the laudanum unless demanded by the severity of the pain,
as it tends to constipate. Give one-half ounce of nitrate of potassium
(saltpeter), dissolved in drinking water, four or five times a day. After the
attack has abated mustard mixed with water may be rubbed well over the left
side of the chest to stimulate the absorption of the fluid within the
pericardium. The other medicines may be discontinued and the following
administered: Sulphate of iron, 2 ounces; powdered gentian, 6 ounces; mix and
make 8 powders. Give one powder every day at noon, mixed with feed, if the
animal will eat it, or shaken up with water in a bottle as a drench. Also the
following: Iodid of potassium, 2 ounces; nitrate of potassium, 8 ounces; mix
and make 16 powders. Give one in drinking water or in drench every morning and
evening. The last two prescriptions may be continued for several weeks if
necessary.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In extreme cases tapping the pericardium with a trocar and cannula to draw
off the fluid is resorted to, but the operation requires exact anatomical
knowledge.</p>

<p>After death from pericarditis there is always more or less fluid found in
the pericardium; the surfaces are rough and covered with a yellow-colored
exudate. There are also in many cases adhesions to a greater or less extent
between the heart and pericardium.</p>

<h4>MYOCARDITIS.</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the muscular structure of the heart occurs in limited,
circumscribed areas, as evidenced by post-mortem examination, and it is
probably always somewhat involved in connection with pericarditis and
endocarditis. It may readily be inferred that if the whole organ were inflamed
death would ensue immediately. Usually myocarditis results from the
preexistence of blood poisoning or of some infectious febrile disease.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The chief symptoms are those of heart weakness. The heart
beat is fast, weak, and often irregular. Respiration is difficult and rapid.
There is great general weakness and depression. Death comes suddenly.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in supporting the animal by the use of
stimulants, such as ammonia, coffee, digitalis, camphor, etc. Complete quiet
must be provided, and the general care should be as in pericarditis.</p>

<h4>ENDOCARDITIS.</h4>

<p>When the membrane which lines the cavities of the heart&mdash;the
endocardium&mdash; suffers inflammation, the disease is called endocarditis.
The cause is another disease, during which substances that irritate the lining
of the heart are produced and admitted into the circulation. These substances
are usually living organisms, or it is possible that in some cases they are
chemical irritants. Endocarditis occurs as a complication of or sequel to
pneumonia, blood poisoning, inflammation of the womb, rheumatism, or severe
wounds or abscesses. The symptoms are much the same as those of pericarditis,
and it is difficult to discriminate between the two affections. There is a
jugular pulse, the legs may become dropsical, and there is a tendency to faint
if the head is elevated suddenly. The bellowslike sound is more distinct than
it is in pericarditis. It is the most fatal of heart diseases, because of the
liability of the formation of clots, which may adhere to the valves, change in
the structure of the valves, and often a complication with an abnormal
condition of the blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
82]</a></span> Clots may be formed in the heart, and, being carried to other
parts, prove fatal by interrupting the circulation in some vital organ.</p>

<p>Treatment similar to that advised for myocarditis may be followed in this
disease.</p>

<h4>VALVES OF THE HEART.</h4>

<p>The valves are subject to abnormal growths and structural changes in chronic
endocarditis or as a result of acute endocarditis. Sometimes valves are torn by
sudden, extreme muscular effort or a congenital abnormality. Cases are also
reported in which they have been found ruptured.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The general symptoms are those of heart weakness,
accompanied with edema and congestion of the lungs.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Relief is sometimes afforded, but usually only temporarily,
by the use of stimulants, especially digitalis.</p>

<h4>RUPTURE OF THE HEART.</h4>

<p>Sudden effort, blows, or disease may lead to rupture of the heart of the ox.
The first cause does not operate so often in cattle as in horses. Tuberculosis
or ulceration from other causes, such as a foreign body, is the most common
source of this accident. Rupture is shown by sudden fainting, followed very
shortly by death.</p>

<h4>HYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION OF THE HEART.</h4>

<p>This is an enlargement of the heart, and may consist of the thickening of
the walls alone, or at the same time the cavities may be either enlarged or
diminished. Dilatation of the cavities has been noticed as existing
independently of thickened walls. In hypertrophy the sounds of the heart are
loud and pronounced, may be heard on both sides of the chest distinctly, and
palpitation occurs to a greater or less extent. Fortunately both conditions are
very rare in cattle.</p>

<h4>ATROPHY.</h4>

<p>Atrophy is the technical term for wasting of the muscular tissue. Atrophy of
the heart is very rare among cattle, and is usually a result of other
diseases.</p>

<h4>FATTY DEGENERATION OF THE HEART.</h4>

<p>This condition of the heart is met with in some very fat cattle, but it must
be understood that the accumulation of fat around the heart is not referred to
by this designation. In fatty degeneration the elements of the muscular tissue
are replaced by fatty or oily granules. The muscle becomes weak, the heart
contractions are insufficient, and heart weakness is shown by general weakness,
shortness of breath, and weak, rapid pulse.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h4>CYANOSIS.</h4>

<p>Owing to the most prominent symptoms, cyanosis is also called "blue
disease," and is seen occasionally in new-born calves. It is recognized by the
blue color of the mucous membrane (easily seen by looking within the mouth and
nostrils), the coldness of the surface of the body, and rapid, labored
breathing. It is caused by non-closure of the foramen ovale, connecting the
right with the left side of the heart, and the consequent mixing of the venous
with the arterial blood. Calves so affected live but a short time.</p>

<h4>MISPLACEMENT OF THE HEART.</h4>

<p>Cases are recorded in which the heart has been found out of its natural
position, sometimes even outside the chest. This is a congenital condition for
which there is no remedy. A heifer calf with the heart entirely outside the
thoracic cavity and beneath the skin in the lower part of the neck was kept for
two years at the veterinary hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, during
which time it grew to be a well-developed cow.</p>

<h4>WOUNDS OF ARTERIES AND VEINS.</h4>

<p>When a blood vessel is opened a glance will tell whether it is an artery or
a vein by simply remembering that bright-red blood comes from arteries and
dark-red from veins. When a vein or a very small artery is severed the blood
flows from the vessel in a continuous and even stream, but when one of the
larger arteries is severed the blood comes in intermitting jets or spurts
corresponding to the beats of the heart. It is well to call attention to the
fact that the dark-red blood which flows or oozes from a wound soon becomes
bright red, because it gives up its carbonic-acid gas to the air, and absorbs
oxygen gas from the air, which is exactly the change it undergoes in the
capillaries of the lungs.</p>

<p>The general treatment of wounds will be found in another section; here it is
necessary only to refer briefly to some of the most practical methods used to
arrest hemorrhages, as instances occur in which an animal may lose much
strength from the loss of blood, or even bleed to death unless action is
prompt.</p>

<h4>BLEEDING (HEMORRHAGE).</h4>

<p>The severity of a hemorrhage depends upon the size of the vessel from which
the blood escapes, though it may be stated that it is more serious when
arteries are severed. If the wound in an artery is in the direction of its
length, the blood escapes more freely than if the vessel is completely severed,
because in the latter instance the severed ends retract, curl in, and may aid
very much in arresting the flow. When <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>the blood merely oozes from the
wound, and even when it flows in a small stream, the forming of the clot
arrests the hemorrhage in a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>Slight hemorrhages may be checked by the continuous application of cold
water, ice, or snow, to the wound, as cold causes contraction of the small
vessels. Water from a hose may be thrown on a wound, or dashed on it from the
hand or a cup, or folds of cotton cloths may be held on it and kept wet. Ice or
snow may be held against the wound, or they may be put into a bag and
conveniently secured in position.</p>

<p>Hot water of an average temperature of 115Â° to 120Â° F. injected into the
vagina or womb is often efficient in arresting hemorrhages from those organs.
Tow, raw cotton, lint, or sponges may be forced into a wound and held or bound
there with bandages. This is an excellent method of checking the flow of blood
until the arrival of an expert. If the flow persists, these articles may be
saturated with tincture of iron, but it is not advisable to use it unless
necessary, as it is a caustic and retards healing by causing a slough. In cases
of necessity, the articles may be saturated with vinegar, or tannic acid or
alum dissolved in water may be used instead. Whatever article is used should be
left in the wound sufficiently long to make sure that its removal will not be
followed by a renewal of the hemorrhage. Sometimes it must remain there one or
two days.</p>

<p>An iron heated white and then pressed on the bleeding vessel for three or
four seconds is occasionally used. It should not be applied longer, or else the
charred tissue will come away with the iron and thus defeat the purpose of its
application.</p>

<p>Compression may be applied in different ways, but only the most convenient
will be mentioned. To many wounds bandages may easily be applied. The bandages
may be made of linen, muslin, etc., sufficiently wide and long, according to
the nature of the wound and the region to be bandaged. Bed sheets torn in
strips the full length make excellent bandages for this purpose. Cotton
batting, tow, or a piece of sponge may be placed on the wound and firmly bound
there with the bandages.</p>

<p>Many cases require ligating, which is almost entirely confined to arteries.
A ligature is a piece of thread or string tied around the vessel. Veins are not
ligated unless very large (and even then only when other means are not
available) on account of the danger of causing phlebitis, or inflammation of a
vein. The ligature is tied around the end of the artery, but in some instances
this is difficult and it is necessary to include some of the adjacent tissue,
although care should be taken not to include a nerve. To apply a ligature, it
is necessary to have artery forceps (tweezers or small pincers may suffice) by
which to draw out the artery in order to tie the string around it. To grasp the
vessel it may be necessary to sponge the blood from <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>the wound so that the end
will be exposed. In case the end of the bleeding artery has retracted, a
sharp-pointed hook, called a tenaculum, is used to draw it out far enough to
tie. The ligature should be drawn tightly, so that the middle and internal
coats will be cut through.</p>

<p>Another method of checking hemorrhage is called torsion. It consists in
catching the end of the bleeding vessel, drawing it out a little, and then
twisting it around a few times with the forceps, which lacerates the internal
coats so that a check is effected. This is very effectual in small vessels, and
is to be preferred to ligatures, because it leaves no foreign body in the
wound. A needle or pin may be stuck through the edges of the wound and a string
passed around between the free ends and the skin (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl.
XXVII</a>, fig. 10), or it may be passed around in the form of a figure 8, as
is often done in the operation of bleeding from the jugular vein.</p>

<h4>ANEURISM.</h4>

<p>A circumscribed dilatation of an artery, constituting a tumor which pulsates
synchronously with the beats of the heart, is called aneurism. It is caused by
disease and rupture of one or two of the arterial coats. The true aneurism
communicates with the interior of the artery and contains coagulated blood. It
is so deeply seated in cattle that treatment is out of the question. Such
abnormalities are ascribable to severe exertion, to old age, to fatty or
calcareous degeneration, or to parasites in the blood vessels. Death is sudden
when caused by the rupture of an aneurism of a large artery, owing to internal
hemorrhage. Sometimes spontaneous recovery occurs. As a rule no symptoms are
caused in cattle by the presence of deep-seated aneurisms, and their presence
is not known until after death.</p>

<p>A false aneurism results from blood escaping from a wounded artery into the
adjacent tissue, where it clots, and the wound, remaining open in the artery,
causes pulsation in the tumor.</p>

<h4>THROMBOSIS (OBSTRUCTION) OF THE ARTERIES.</h4>

<p>Arteries become obstructed as a result of wounds and other injuries to them,
as those caused by the formation of an abscess or the extension of inflammation
from surrounding structures to the coats of an artery. Arteries are also
obstructed by the breaking off of particles of a plug or clot, partly
obstructing the aorta or other large artery. These small pieces (emboli) are
floated to an artery that is too small to permit them to pass and are there
securely held, producing obstruction. These obstructions are shown by loss of
power in the muscles supplied by the obstructed artery and by excitation of the
heart and by respiration after exercise. The loss of power may not come into
evidence until after exercise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86"
id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;While standing still or when walking slowly the animal may
appear to be normal, but after more active exercise a group of muscles, a leg,
or both hind legs, may be handled with difficulty, causing lameness, and later
there is practically a local paralysis. These symptoms disappear with rest. In
some cases the collateral circulation develops in time, so that the parts
receive sufficient blood and the symptoms disappear.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF VEINS (PHLEBITIS).</h4>

<p>When bleeding is performed without proper care or with an unclean lancet,
inflammation of the vein may result, or it may be caused by the animal rubbing
the wound against some object. When inflammation follows the operation, the
coats of the vein become so much enlarged that the vessel may be felt hard and
knotted beneath the skin, and pressure produces pain. A thin, watery discharge,
tinged with blood, issues from the wound. The blood becomes coagulated in the
vessel. In inflammation of the jugular the coagulation extends from the wound
upward to the first large branch. Abscesses may form along the course of the
vein. The inflammation is followed by obliteration of that part in which
coagulation exists. This is of small import, as cattle have an accessory
jugular vein which gradually enlarges and accommodates itself to the increased
quantity of blood it must carry.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment for inflammation of the vein is to clip the
hair from along the course of the affected vessel and apply a blister, the
cerate of cantharides. Abscesses should be opened as soon as they form, because
there is a possibility of the pus getting into the circulation.</p>

<p>In the operation of bleeding the instruments should be clean and free from
rust. If the skin is not sufficiently opened, or when closing the wound the
skin is drawn out too much, blood may accumulate in the tissue, and if it does
it should be removed by pressing absorbent cotton or a sponge on the part. Care
should also be used in opening the vein, so that the instrument may not pass
entirely through both sides of the vein and open the artery beneath it.</p>

<h2><a name="NONCONTAGIOUS_DISEASES_OF_THE_ORGANS"
id="NONCONTAGIOUS_DISEASES_OF_THE_ORGANS"></a>NONCONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF THE
ORGANS OF RESPIRATION.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">William Herbert Lowe, D. V. S.</span></h3>

<h4>DIAGNOSIS.</h4>

<p>In the determination of disease in the human being the physician, in making
his diagnosis, is aided by both subjective and objective symptoms, but the
veterinary physician, in a very large majority of cases, is obliged to rely
almost solely upon objective symptoms, and perhaps in no class of diseases is
this more true than in the exploration of those under consideration. This
condition of affairs has a strong tendency to develop observation and
discernment in the veterinarian, and not infrequently do we find that the
successful veterinary practitioner is a very accurate diagnostician. In order
to make a differential diagnosis, however, it is not only necessary to know the
structure and functions of the organs in health, but to adopt a rigid system of
details of examination, without which successful results can not be reached.</p>

<p><em>History</em>.&mdash;The history of a case should always be ascertained so far as
possible. The information obtained is sometimes unsatisfactory and not to be
depended upon, but even when this is the case it is advisable to weigh the
evidence from every point of view.</p>

<p>In connection with the history of every case it is always of primary
importance to ascertain the cause of illness. A knowledge of the origin and
development of a disease is important, both in making a diagnosis and in
formulating the treatment. Exposure to cold and dampness is frequently the
exciting cause of affections of the organs of respiration.</p>

<p>The experienced practitioner is always sure to ascertain whether the
particular animal he is called on to attend is the only one in the stable or on
the premises that is similarly affected. If several animals are similarly
affected, the disease may have a common cause, which may or may not be of an
infectious nature.</p>

<p>Another thing that the experienced practitioner ascertains is what previous
treatment, if any, the animal has had. Medicine given in excessive doses
sometimes produces symptoms resembling those of disease.</p>

<p>The hygienic and sanitary conditions must always be considered in connection
with the cause as well as the treatment of disease. <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Much of the disease which
occurs in large dairies and elsewhere could be prevented if owners and those in
charge of animals had proper regard for the fundamental laws of animal hygiene
and modern sanitation. Disregard for these laws is the cause of most of the
diseases under consideration in this chapter.</p>

<p><em>Attitude and general condition</em>.&mdash;The feeling of pain in animals
suffering from serious affections of the organs of respiration is expressed to
the close observer in no uncertain language&mdash;by their flinching when the
painful part is touched; by the care with which they move or lie down; by
walking or standing to "favor" the part; by the general attitude and expression
of the eye; by the distress and suffering apparent in the face; and by other
evidences.</p>

<p>The general physical condition and attitude of the sick animal tell the
careful observer much that aids him in making a diagnosis and prognosis. Cows
suffering from affections of the organs of respiration usually assume a
position or attitude that is characteristic, well known to experienced
stockmen, as well as to veterinarians. When an animal has a fever or is
suffering from an inflammation, the skin is one of the first parts to undergo a
change that is apparent to the average observer, for it soon loses its
elasticity and tone, and the hair becomes dry and staring.</p>

<p>From the general condition or state of nutrition one is able to judge the
effect that the disease has already had upon the animal and to estimate the
strength remaining available for its restoration to health; from the degree of
emaciation one can approximate the length of time the animal has been ill. The
age and breed of the animal, as well as its constitution and temperament, are
among the things that have to be taken into account in making a diagnosis and
in overcoming the disease.</p>

<p><em>The mucous membrane</em>.&mdash;The mucous membrane should in all cases be
examined. It can be readily seen by everting the eyelids or by an inspection of
the lining membrane of the nostrils.</p>

<p>Paleness of the mucous membrane indicates weak circulation or poor blood and
may result from disease, hemorrhage, or from inappropriate feed.</p>

<p>In healthy animals increased redness of the mucous membrane occurs from
pain, excitement, or severe exertion, and in such instances is always
transitory. In certain pathological conditions, such as fevers and
inflammation, this condition of the mucous membrane will also be found. The
increased redness of the mucous membrane lasts during the duration of the fever
or inflammation.</p>

<p>A bluish or blue mucous membrane indicates that the blood is imperfectly
oxidized and contains an excess of carbon dioxid, and is seen in serious
diseases of the respiratory tract, such as pneumonia, and in heart
failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg
89]</a></span></p>

<p><em>The secretions</em>.&mdash;The secretions may be diminished, increased, or
perverted. In the early stage of an inflammation of a secretory organ its
secretion is diminished. In the early stage of pleurisy the serous membrane is
dry, and as the disease advances the membrane becomes unnaturally moist. The
products of secretion are sometimes greatly changed in character from the
secretion in health, becoming excessively irritant and yielding evidence of
chemical and other alterations in the character of the secretion.</p>

<p><em>Cough</em>.&mdash;Cough depends upon a reflex nervous action and may be primary
when the irritation exists in the lungs or air passages, or secondary when
caused by irritation of the stomach, intestines, or other parts having nervous
communications with the respiratory apparatus. A cough is said to be dry,
moist, harsh, hollow, difficult, paroxysmal, suppressed, sympathetic, etc.,
according to its character. It is a very important symptom, often being
diagnostic in diseases of the respiratory organs, but this is a subject,
however, which can be more satisfactorily treated in connection with the
special diseases of the organs in question.</p>

<p><em>Respiration</em>.&mdash;In making an examination of an animal observe the depth,
frequency, quickness, facility, and the nature of the respiratory movements.
They may be quick or slow, frequent or infrequent, deep or imperfect, labored,
unequal, irregular, etc., each of which indications has its significance to the
experienced veterinarian.</p>

<p>Sleep, rumination, pregnancy in cows, etc., modify the respiratory movements
even in health. Respiration consists of two acts&mdash;inspiration and
expiration. The function of respiration is to take in oxygen from the
atmospheric air, which is essential for the maintenance of life, and to exhale
the deleterious gas known as "carbon dioxid."</p>

<p>The frequency of the respiratory movements is determined by observing the
motions of the nostrils or of the flanks. The normal rate of respiration for a
healthy animal of the bovine species is from 15 to 18 times a minute. The
extent of the respiratory system renders it liable to become affected by
contiguity to many parts and its nervous connections are very important.</p>

<p>Rapid, irregular, or difficult breathing is known as dyspnea, and in all
such cases the animal has difficulty in obtaining as much oxygen as it
requires. Among the conditions that give rise to dyspnea may be mentioned
restricted area of active lung tissue, owing to the filling of portions of the
lungs with inflammatory exudate, as in pneumonia; painful movements of the
chest, as in rheumatism or pleurisy; fluid in the chest cavity, as in
hydrothorax; adhesions between the lungs and chest walls; compression of the
lungs or loss of elasticity; excess of carbon dioxid in the blood; weakness of
the respiratory passages; tumors of the nose and paralysis <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>of the throat; swellings of
the throat; foreign bodies and constriction of the air passages leading to
the lungs; fevers, etc.</p>

<p>As already stated, it is only the careful and constant examination of
animals in health that will enable one properly to appreciate abnormal
conditions. One must become familiar with the frequency and character of the
pulse and of the respirations and know the temperature of the animal in health,
before changes in abnormal conditions can be properly appreciated.</p>

<p><em>Temperature</em>.&mdash;The temperature should be taken in all cases of sickness.
Experienced practitioners can approximate the patient's temperature with
remarkable accuracy, but I strongly recommend the use of the self-registering
clinical thermometer, which is a most valuable instrument in diagnosing
diseases. (See <a href="#PLATE_III">Pl. III</a>, fig. 1.) It is advisable to
get a tested instrument, as some thermometers in the market are inaccurate and
misleading. The proper place to insert the thermometer is in the rectum, where
the instrument should be rested against the walls of the cavity for about three
minutes. The normal temperature of the bovine is 101Â° to 102Â° F., which is
higher than that of the horse. A cow breathes faster, her heart beats faster,
and her internal temperature is higher than that of the horse. Ordinary
physiological influences&mdash;such as exercise, digestion, etc.&mdash;give
rise to slight variations of internal temperature; but if the temperature rises
two or three degrees above the normal some diseased condition is indicated.</p>

<p><em>Pulse</em>.&mdash;The pulse in a grown animal of the bovine species in a state of
good health beats from 45 to 55 times a minute. Exercise, fright, fear,
excitement, overfeeding, pregnancy, and other conditions aside from disease may
affect the frequency and character of the pulse. It assumes various characters
according to its rapidity of beat, frequency of occurrence, resistance to
pressure, regularity, and perceptibility. Thus we have the quick or slow,
frequent or infrequent, hard or soft, full or imperceptible, large or small
pulse, the character of each of which may be determined from its name; also
that known as the intermittent, either regular or irregular. We may have a
dicrotic, or double, pulse; a thready pulse, which is extremely small and
scarcely perceptible; the venous, or jugular, pulse; the "running down" pulse,
and so on. (See <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>.)</p>

<p>In cattle the pulse is conveniently felt over the submaxillary artery where
it winds around the lower jawbone, just at the lower edge of the flat muscle on
the side of the cheek. If the cow is lying down the pulse may be taken from the
metacarpal artery on the back part of the fore fetlock. The pulsations can be
felt from any superficial artery, but in order to ascertain the peculiarities
it is necessary to select an artery that may be pressed against a bone.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%;" />

<p>There is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
marked difference in the normal or physiological pulse of the horse
and that of the cow, that of the horse being full and rather tense, while in
the cow it is soft and rolling. The pulse is faster in young or old cattle than
it is in those of middle age.</p>

<p><em>Auscultation</em>.&mdash;Auscultation and percussion are the chief methods used
to determine the various pathological changes that occur in the respiratory
organs. Auscultation is the act of listening, and may be either mediate or
immediate. Mediate auscultation is accomplished by aid of an instrument known
as the stethoscope, one extremity of which is applied to the ear and the other
to the chest of the animal. In immediate auscultation the ear is applied
directly to the part. Immediate auscultation will answer in a large majority of
cases. Auscultation is resorted to in cardiac and certain abdominal diseases,
but it is mainly employed for determining the condition of the lungs and air
passages. Animals can not give the various phases of respiration, as can the
patients of the human practitioner. The organs themselves are less accessible
than in man, owing to the greater bulk of tissue surrounding them and the
pectoral position of the fore extremities, all of which render it more
difficult in determining pathological conditions. (See <a
href="#PLATE_VIII">Pl. VIII</a>.)</p>

<p>The air going in and out of the lungs makes a certain soft, rustling sound,
known as the vesicular murmur, which can be heard distinctly in a healthy state
of the animal, especially upon inspiration. Exercise accelerates the rate of
respiration and intensifies this sound. The vesicular murmur is heard only
where the lung contains air and its function is active. The vesicular murmur is
weakened as inflammatory infiltration takes place and when the lungs are
compressed by fluids in the thoracic cavity, and disappears when the lung
becomes solidified in pneumonia or the chest cavity filled with fluid as in
hydrothorax. The bronchial murmur is a harsh, blowing sound, heard in normal
conditions by applying the ear over the lower part of the trachea, and may be
heard to a limited extent in the anterior portions of the lungs after severe
exercise. The bronchial murmur when heard over other portions of the lungs
generally signifies that the lung tissue has become more or less solidified or
that fluid has collected in the chest cavity.</p>

<p>Other sounds, known as mucous rÃ¢les, are heard in the lungs in pneumonia
after the solidified parts begin to break down at the end of the disease and in
bronchitis where there is an excess of secretion, as well as in other
conditions. Mucous rÃ¢les are of a gargling or bubbling nature. They are caused
by air rushing through tubes containing secretions or pus. They are said to be
large or small as they are distinct or indistinct, depending upon the quantity
of fluid that is present and the size of the tubes in which the sound is
produced. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
According to their character they are divided into dry and moist. The friction
sound is produced by the rubbing together of roughened surfaces and is
characteristic of pleurisy.</p>

<p><em>Percussion</em>.&mdash;Percussion is that mode of examination by which we elicit
sounds by striking or tapping over the part. It may be direct or indirect. If
the middle finger of the left hand is placed firmly on the chest and smartly
tapped or struck with the ends of the first three fingers of the right hand,
the sound will be noticed to be more resonant and clear than when the same
procedure is practiced on a solid part of the body. This is because the lungs
are not solid, but are always, in health, well expanded with air. In certain
pulmonary diseases, however, as in pneumonia, they fill up and become solid,
when percussion produces a dull sound, like that on any other solid part of the
animal. When fluid has collected in the lower part of the chest cavity the
sound will also be dull on percussion. Where there is an excess of air in the
chest cavity, as in emphysema or in pneumothorax, the percussion sound becomes
abnormally loud and clear. By practice on healthy animals the character and
boundaries of the sounds can be so well determined that any variation from them
will be readily detected, and will sometimes disclose the presence of a
diseased condition when nothing else will.</p>

<p>Percussion is sometimes practiced with the aid of a special percussion
hammer and an object known as a pleximeter to strike upon. A percussion hammer
is made of rubber or has a rubber tip, so that when the pleximeter, which is
placed against the side of the animal, is struck the impact will not be
accompanied with a noise. A percussion hammer and pleximeter may be purchased
from any veterinary instrument maker.</p>

<h4>CATARRH (COLD IN THE HEAD).</h4>

<p>Nasal catarrh is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nostrils and
upper air passages. Simple catarrh is not a serious disease in itself, but if
neglected is liable to be complicated with laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia,
plurisy, or other serious and sometimes fatal diseases of the respiratory
organs. Catarrh is a common disease among cattle. It is often caused by sudden
exposure to wet and cold after they have been accustomed to shelter. It may
arise from inhalation of irritating gases. It is also sometimes produced by
certain specific atmospheric conditions, and may assume an enzoÃ¶tic form. It is
very debilitating, and requires prompt and judicious treatment.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Redness of the mucous membranes of the nose and redness and
watering of the eyes are symptoms of nasal catarrh. The mucous membrane first
becomes dry; afterwards a watery discharge appears, and later, in severe cases,
the discharge becomes mucopurulent. In mild cases there is little or no
fever, but in severe ones it may run high. The animal becomes dull, languid,
and is not inclined to move about, and the appetite may become impaired; there
is also variable temperature of the horns and ears. If in a cow giving milk the
secretion diminishes, the mucus from the eyes and nose becomes thicker and
yellower. Afterwards, as the symptoms increase in severity, the discharge
becomes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
mucopurulent.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The animal should be housed in a well-ventilated place,
with good hygienic surroundings. In cold and damp weather it should be kept
warm with blanketing, and, in severe cases, hot, medicated inhalations given.
If the fever is high, it may be reduced by giving nitrate of potassium, from 1
to 2 ounces, in the drinking water, three times daily. Diffusible stimulants
are beneficial in most cases. Too much importance can not be attached to good
nursing. There is no necessity to resort to the old system of bleeding,
purging, or the use of powerful sedatives.</p>

<h4>EPISTAXIS (BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE).</h4>

<p>Bleeding from the nostrils is rather rare in cattle. It may arise from any
one of a variety of causes, but usually results from disease or injury to the
mucous membranes or to violent exertions in coughing and sneezing. It is seldom
serious. It generally occurs in drops from one nostril only, accompanied with
sneezing, and without frothing. Bleeding from the lungs comes from both
nostrils, is bright red, frothy, and accompanied with a cough.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In many cases the bleeding will cease spontaneously and all
that is necessary is to keep the animal quiet and bathe the head and nostrils
with cold water. The cause of the bleeding should be learned and governed
accordingly in the treatment. In severe and exceptional cases, when the
hemorrhage is persistent and long continued, the animal's head should be tied
to a high rack or beam and cold water or ice applied, or recourse to styptic
injections taken. If the hemorrhage is profuse and persistent, either a drench
composed of 1&frac12; drams of acetate of lead dissolved in a pint of water or
1&frac12; drams of gallic acid dissolved in a pint of water should be given.</p>

<h4>LARYNGITIS (SORE THROAT).</h4>

<p>An inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the larynx is known as
laryngitis. It may be either a primary or a secondary disease, complicated or
uncomplicated. In the majority of cases it is attributable to some form of
exposure, a sudden change from warm to cold surroundings, or exposure to cold
storms. It may also result from inhaling irritating gases or from external
violence. In an acute attack of laryngitis there is an elevation of
temperature, pain on pressure over the region of the larynx, violent paroxysms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
coughing, difficult and noisy respiration. The nostrils are dilated, the nose
extended, and the animal has a frightened expression. There is marked
difficulty in swallowing.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists of fomentations and hot applications
over the throat. Stimulating liniments, mustard mixed with cold water and well
rubbed in with a stiff brush, or other forms of counterirritation may be
applied in severe cases. Hot inhalations should be frequently resorted to, and
often afford much relief to the suffering animal. In this disease medicines
should be given so far as possible in the form of electuaries (soft solid) on
account of the difficulty of deglutition. Large drafts of medicines have a
tendency to produce violent spells of coughing, and in this way retard
recovery. The subjoined formula for an electuary will be found to answer the
purpose in ordinary cases: Chlorate of potassium, pulverized, 8 ounces; fluid
extract of belladonna, 2 ounces; powdered opium, 1 ounce; powdered licorice
root, 8 ounces; sirup, sufficient quantity; mix. Place a small tablespoonful of
the mixture frequently on the tongue or back teeth. Or the following may be
used instead: Aloes, powdered opium, and gum camphor in equal parts; mix. Rub
an ounce on the molar teeth every four or five hours. The bowels should be kept
open and the diet should be such as the patient can easily swallow. Warm,
sloppy mashes, boiled oatmeal gruel, linseed tea, and the like are the most
suitable substances. If suffocation be threatened during the course of the
disease, tracheotomy should be performed without delay. The details of the
operation are fully described under the head of "Surgical operations." (See p.
289.)</p>

<p>When the disease assumes a chronic form, strong counterirritation is
indicated. A cantharides blister may be applied, or the following ointment
used: Biniodid of mercury 1 part, lard 6 parts; mix. In some cases it will be
found necessary to repeat the application.</p>

<h4>BRONCHITIS.</h4>

<p>Bronchitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes.
When a primary disease, it is generally the result of what is commonly known as
"catching cold." It may be secondary to or complicated with many of the
diseases of the respiratory system. It may also be caused by breathing
irritating gases, or by the introduction of foreign bodies into the bronchial
tubes, which sometimes results from injudicious and careless drenching when the
larynx is temporarily relaxed. It may be acute or chronic, and is divided,
according to the seat of the inflammation, into bronchitis proper when the
large tubes are affected, or capillary bronchitis when the trouble is in the
smaller ones.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Loss of appetite, elevation of temperature, generally 104Â°
or 105Â° F. The inspiration is incomplete, short, and painful, <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>and the expiration is
prolonged. The pulse is increased in frequency and is hard. A characteristic,
painful cough is present, but it is paroxysmal and incomplete. Auscultation and
percussion greatly aid us in a diagnosis. A normal sound is given on
percussion. On auscultation, in the early stages, rhonchus rÃ¢les are detected
if the larger tubes are affected, and sibilant rÃ¢les if the smaller ones are
affected. Later mucous rÃ¢les are noted, and sometimes all sounds in certain
parts are absent, owing to the plugging up of the tubes. This plugging, if
extensive enough, is sometimes the cause of death, or death may result from
extension of the disease to the lungs or pleura.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The animal should be placed in a light, well-ventilated
box, and the bowels kept in a soft condition by enemas, etc. Violent purgatives
should not be used. The body should be kept warm by blanketing. In the early
stages a draft composed as follows should be given three times daily: Extract
of belladonna, 2 drams; solution of acetate of ammonium, 4 fluid ounces; water,
one-half pint. In the later stage of the disease the following formula may be
substituted and given twice daily: Carbonate of ammonium, 3 drams; liquor
hydrochlorate of strychnin, 2 fluid drams; spirits of nitrous ether, 1 fluid
ounce; water, one-half pint.</p>

<p>In some cases the following is preferable to either of the above, and may be
given in a pint of linseed tea every four hours: Spirits of nitrous ether,
1&frac12; ounces; aromatic spirits of ammonia, 2 ounces; powdered camphor, 2 drams.
The feed should be light and nutritious.</p>

<p>Bronchitis is liable to become chronic if not properly treated in the
earliest stage. In this case remedial treatment is of little value.</p>

<h4>PLEURISY.</h4>

<p>Pleurisy is an inflammation of the serous membrane lining the chest cavity
and enveloping the lungs. It is somewhat rare as an independent disease, but it
often complicates pneumonia; indeed, it is often caused by the same germ that
causes pneumonia&mdash;pneumococcus. It may arise from exposure to cold or wet
or from external violence, and is usually present in some degree in cases in
which the ribs have been fractured with or without a penetrated wound.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;In the first stage there is great pain aggravated by
movement, and the animal is usually stiff as though foundered, the pulse is
quick and hard, the breathing abdominal, the chest being fixed so far as
possible, the inspiration short and jerky, the expiration longer. The pain is
caused by the friction of the dry, inflamed pleural surfaces of the lung and
chest on each other. At this stage the ear detects a dry friction murmur,
resembling somewhat the sound made by rubbing two pieces of sole leather
together. Pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a>
</span>sure between the ribs gives pain and usually causes the animal to
flinch and grunt. The muzzle is hot and dry, the mouth slimy, and the
secretions scanty. After a day or two the severity of the symptoms is much
lessened, the temperature, which during the first days may have been as high as
106Â° F., falls to 103Â° or 104Â°, the pain decreases, the stiffness disappears,
and the patient eats a little. The pulse softens, but remains quicker than
normal. Now, day by day the patient loses a little strength, the friction sound
disappears as the exudation moistens the pleural surfaces; percussion now shows
a horizontal line of dullness, which day by day rises higher in the chest, the
respiration grows more frequent and labored, the countenance is anxious and
haggard, the eyes sink somewhat in their sockets, and in unfavorable cases
death occurs during the second or third week, from either asphyxia or heart
failure.</p>

<p>In pleurisy, as in pneumonia, the elbows are usually turned outward. Care
must be taken to differentiate pleurisy from traumatic pericarditis (which
see). In the latter condition the area of dullness of the heart is much
increased, and usually a splashing sound is heard at each beat of the heart.
Another diagnostic symptom of value is that in traumatic pericarditis
respiration is painful, not difficult, and the respiratory rate is very much
increased on movement. In both conditions a considerable swelling of the dewlap
may be noticed in the later stages.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give the same general care as recommended in bronchitis or
pneumonia. In the early stages give a febrifuge to reduce the fever, as
directed for pneumonia. For relief of the cough give electuary formula, which
will be found in the treatment of laryngitis. The bowels must be kept relaxed
and the kidneys secreting freely. In the stage of effusion the following should
be given three times daily: Digitalis tincture, 1 ounce; iodid of potassium, 30
to 60 grains; mix. Apply strong counterirritant to chest and put seton in
dewlap. (See "Setoning," <a href="#Page_293">p. 293</a>.) If collapse of the lung is threatened, a
surgical operation, termed paracentesis thoracis, is sometimes performed; this
consists in puncturing the chest cavity and drawing off a part of the fluid.
The instruments used are a small trocar and cannula, which are introduced
between the eighth and ninth ribs. The skin should be drawn forward so that the
external wound may not correspond to the puncture of the chest, to prevent the
entrance of air. Only a portion of the fluid should be removed. The animal gets
immediate relief, but it is generally only temporary, as the fluid has a
tendency to accumulate again.</p>

<h4>PNEUMONIA.</h4>

<p>Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung substance, and is divided into
three forms, viz, croupous, catarrhal, and interstitial. These <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>various forms,
however, can be differentiated only by the expert, and it is therefore deemed
necessary for the purpose of the present work to treat the subject under the
general head of pneumonia.</p>

<p>The causes of pneumonia in general are the same as those of the various
other inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. The germ is known as a
pneumococcus. The disease mostly follows congestion of the lungs, but may in
rare cases have a parasitic origin.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;In the first stage, that of congestion, the disease is
usually ushered in by a chill, although this may not always be observed by the
attendant. This is followed by an elevation of temperature, usually 105Â° to
106Â° F., or it may be even higher. The respirations are quick and shallow; the
nostrils are dilated; the pulse is full and hard. Cough may or may not appear
in this stage. The nose is hot and dry; the tongue sometimes protrudes and is
slimy; the coat is staring, and the skin dry and harsh. The urine is usually
diminished in quantity, high colored, and the bowels constipated. The animal
stands with the forelegs wide apart to facilitate respiration. On auscultation
crepitation will be observed over the portion of the lung affected. The sounds
elicited on percussion are practically normal in this stage.</p>

<p>In the second stage the temperature generally drops one or two degrees, and
respiration is performed with much difficulty. The cough is frequent and
painful. The animal still stands with the forelegs wide apart and the elbows
turned outward. If it assumes the recumbent position it rests on the sternum.
All secretions are more or less suspended, particularly the milk in cows. The
animal has a haggard appearance, and the pulse becomes small and wiry at this
period. The extremities are hot and cold alternately; the crepitation which was
present in the first stage is now absent, and no sound on auscultation is
heard, unless it is a slight wheezing or whistling noise. On percussion
dullness over the diseased lung is manifested, indicating consolidation. The
lung has now assumed a characteristic liverlike appearance.</p>

<p>In the third stage, if the disease is to terminate favorably, the cough
becomes loose, the animal improves, the appetite returns, and the symptoms
above detailed rapidly subside; if, on the other hand, resolution is not
progressing, the lung substance degenerates, becomes clogged up, and ceases to
function. In fatal cases the breath has a peculiar, fetid, cadaverous odor, and
is taken in short gasps; the horns, ears, and extremities become cold and
clammy, and the pulse is imperceptible. On auscultation, when suppuration is
taking place and the lung structure is breaking down, a bubbling or gurgling
crepitation, caused by the passage of air through pus, is heard.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Good hygienic surroundings and good nursing are essential
in connection with the medical treatment. The probability <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>of recovery depends
largely on the extent of the lung tissue involved, as well as on the intensity
of the inflammatory process. In the early stage, when the fever is high,
febrifuges should be given. If the pulse be strong and full, aconite (Fleming's
tincture, 1 to 2 drams, every four or five hours) may be given for a short
time, but should be discontinued as soon as the fever begins to abate. Aconite
is a valuable drug in the hands of the intelligent practitioner, but my
experience leads me to believe that not infrequently animals are lost by its
injudicious use, for in many febrile conditions it is positively
contraindicated, owing to its action upon the heart. In a plethoric animal,
with a strong, bounding pulse, bleeding may be resorted to instead of
administering aconite. If the bowels are constipated, calomel, 1 to 3 drams,
which acts as a cathartic and a febrifuge, is advisable. In the second stage
diffusible stimulants are required, viz: Spirits of nitrous ether, 2 ounces;
aromatic spirits of ammonia, 1 ounce; mix, and give in gruel three times daily.
In some cases carbonate of ammonia, 2 to 5 drams, has been found beneficial.
Most practitioners apply counterirritants, such as mustard plasters,
turpentine, and ammonia liniment, or cantharides.</p>

<h4>EMPHYSEMA (HEAVES).</h4>

<p>Emphysema is a rupture of the minute air vesicles of the lung substance, and
may be either interlobular or vesicular. There is an extreme interference with
respiration, inspiration being short and expiration prolonged. It is a
nonfebrile condition, in which the appetite is not decreased and the milk
secretion is kept up. It may be caused by an attack of asthma or may result
from chronic bronchitis. The disease can be diagnosed by the marked
interference with respiration. The animal, as a rule, is emaciated, has a
staring coat, and is hidebound. If percussion is resorted to, the animal's
chest will give a tympanic, drumlike sound. The normal resonant sound is
exaggerated.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The disease is incurable, and only a palliative form of
treatment can be carried out. The destruction of the animal is often advisable,
from a humane as well as from a financial point of view.</p>

<h4>PULMONARY CONGESTION.</h4>

<p>Cattle that are overdriven or overworked are liable to pulmonary congestion
in an acute form, and sometimes to pulmonary apoplexy. In such cases they
should be allowed to rest, and if the weather is hot, they should be put in a
shady place. Give stimulants internally, unload the venous side of the heart by
bleeding, and apply stimulating applications to the legs, and bandage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<h4>HEMOPTYSIS.</h4>

<p>Hemoptysis is a term used to signify bleeding from the lungs. The trouble
may result from a previous congestion of the lungs or from a breaking down of
the lung substance, or from specific disorders.</p>

<p>Bleeding from the lungs comes from both nostrils and from the mouth. The
blood is bright red, frothy, and accompanied with a cough, the flow being
somewhat profuse and intermingled with mucus. It may cease of its own accord.
Internally hemostatics are indicated, and locally over the sides cold
applications have a tendency to check the hemorrhage. A drench of 1&frac12; drams
of gallic acid dissolved in a pint of water should be given.</p>

<h4>ABSCESS OF THE LUNG.</h4>

<p>Abscesses of the lung sometimes form during the course of or subsequent to
tuberculosis or other diseases. An animal affected with abscess of the lung
usually has a protracted, feeble cough and a general appearance of emaciation
and anemia. The pulse is feeble and the breath foul. An offensive discharge
from the lungs frequently occurs. Percussion and auscultation aid in making a
diagnosis in this condition. The appetite is poor. Such animals go from bad to
worse, and their prompt destruction would, as a rule, be to the interest of the
owner.</p>

<h4>HYDROTHORAX.</h4>

<p>Hydrothorax, or dropsy of the chest, is not a disease in itself, but is
simply a condition in which an effusion takes place in the chest cavity, and is
the result or effect of some disease, mostly pleurisy. It can be easily
diagnosed by physical signs. A loss of the respiratory murmur will be noticed
on auscultation, and on percussion dullness or flatness on a line as high as
the effusion has taken place. When a large amount of effusion is present,
tapping with the trocar and cannula is generally resorted to. The proper method
of performing this operation will be found under the head of "Pleurisy."</p>

<h4>PNEUMOTHORAX.</h4>

<p>An accumulation of gas in the pleural sac is known as pneumothorax. The
presence of air may result from either an injury of the lung or a wound
communicating from the exterior. The indications for treatment are to remove
any foreign body that may have penetrated, to exclude the further entrance of
the air into the cavity by the closure of the external opening, and to employ
antiseptics and adhesive dressings. The air already in the cavity will in most
cases be absorbed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<h4>VERMINOUS BRONCHITIS.</h4>

<p>This is a disease that sometimes attacks young cattle when pastured in
low-lying meadows near rivers subject to flood. It is caused by a small worm,
<em>Strongylus micrurus</em>, which lodges in large numbers in the trachea and bronchial
tubes, giving rise to considerable irritation of the air passages and
inflammation. Sometimes the strongyles lodge in large numbers in the windpipe,
forming themselves into a ball, and thus choke the animal to death.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;It is liable to attack a number of animals at once, and the
weakest are the first to give way. The animal has a remarkably forcible cough,
distressing, and of a special hacking and paroxysmal character. A stringy mucus
is sometimes expelled during the spells of coughing. This mucus contains the
Strongylus micrurus, which can be detected, or their ova observed, under a low
power of the microscope. The attack has a subacute character and is very
exhausting. The parasites, by becoming entwined in balls, seriously impede
respiration, which is always remarkably labored in this disease.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The affected calves should be placed in a dry stable,
protected from dampness, and subjected to fumigations of sulphurous anhydrid or
chlorin gas. The liberation of chlorin gas is brought about by the action of
sulphuric acid, either on a mixture of chlorid of sodium and black oxid of
manganese or on bleaching powder. Sulphurous anhydrid may be procured by
burning sulphur. Some practitioners prescribe small doses of spirits of
turpentine in linseed oil. The system requires good support, and the diet
should therefore be liberal and nutritious. Equal parts of sulphate of iron,
gentian, and ginger make an excellent tonic.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Avoid pastures notorious for generating verminous
bronchitis.</p>

<h4>PLEURODYNIA.</h4>

<p>Pleurodynia is a term applied to rheumatism of the intercostal muscles, the
apparent symptoms being very similar to those of pleurisy. The animal is stiff,
is not inclined to turn around, and the ribs are kept in a fixed state as much
as possible. Pleurodynia may be distinguished from pleurisy by the coexistence
of rheumatism in other parts and by the comparative absence of fever, cough,
the friction sound, and the effusion into the chest. The treatment for this
affection is the same as that for rheumatism affecting other parts.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_NERVOUS_SYSTEM" id="DISEASES_OF_THE_NERVOUS_SYSTEM"></a>DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">W. H. Harbaugh, V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by John E. Mohler, V. M. D.]</h5>

<h4>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>The nervous system is the distinguishing feature of animal life. Without it
there can be no intelligence, no instinct, no sensibility, no perception; in
fact, existence would be nothing more than vegetable life.</p>

<p>The senses&mdash;touch, taste, sight, hearing, smell&mdash;all depend on the
nervous system. Motion depends on it. A muscle can not contract without
receiving the stimulus from the nervous system. For example, if a nerve passing
from a nerve center to a muscle is severed, the particular muscle that is
supplied by the cut nerve is paralyzed.</p>

<p>The nervous system is often studied in two divisions&mdash;the cerebrospinal
division and the sympathetic division.</p>

<p>The cerebrospinal division consists of the brain and spinal cord, nerves,
and ganglia. The nerves of this division convey the impulses of motion and
sensation and supply all parts which are under the control of the will. For
example, the voluntary muscular tissue includes all the muscles which act as
the will directs. Another example: If anything comes in contact with any part
of the skin, the impression is immediately perceived. All the special senses
belong to this division.</p>

<p>The sympathetic division consists of nerves and ganglia. The muscular
tissue, which acts independently of the will&mdash;as, for example, the
stomach, intestines, womb, blood vessels, ducts, etc.&mdash;is called
involuntary muscular tissue, and receives nervous stimulus from the sympathetic
division.</p>

<p>The brain, spinal cord, and the ganglia are the central organs of the
nervous system. The nerves conduct the nervous influence. The nerves terminate
differently according to their function. The terminations are called end
organs. The terminal end organs in the skin and other parts endowed with
sensation receive the impressions, which are conveyed to the brain, where they
are appreciated. They are so sensitive that the most gentle zephyr is
perceived. They are so abundant that the point of the finest needle can not
pierce the skin without coming in contact with them, and the sensation of pain
is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
instantly conveyed to the brain. The terminal end organs of the nerves that
supply the muscles are different, as they give the impulse which is conveyed by
the motor nerves to the elements which constitute the muscle, and this impulse
is the excitation which causes the muscle to contract. The terminal end organs
of the special senses of taste, smell, etc., receive their special impressions,
and their respective nerves carry the impressions to the brain.</p>

<p>There are two divisions of nerves, the afferent and efferent.</p>

<p>The afferent nerves are those which convey the impression to the nerve
centers. All the sensory nerves belong to this division.</p>

<p>The efferent nerves are those which convey the nervous impulse outward from
the nerve centers, and they are further classified according to the function of
their respective centers. For example: Motor fibers carry the impulse from the
nerve center to a muscle to cause contraction. Vasomotor fibers carry the
impulse to the muscular tissue in the blood vessels, which regulates their
caliber. The secretory fibers convey the impulse to the cells of the glands and
excite the activity of the gland, and its particular product is secreted or
evolved, as, for instance, milk in the mammary gland. Inhibitory fibers control
or inhibit the action of the organ to which they are distributed, as, for
instance, the heart.</p>

<p>Nerve centers may be considered as a collection or group of nerve cells.
Both the cerebrospinal and the sympathetic divisions have nerve centers. The
centers derive their special names from their functions. The brain is the great
center of the nervous system, as it is the center of intelligence and
perception. The centers of all the special senses, as well as the centers of
various functions, are located in different parts of the brain. Nerve centers
also exist in the spinal cord and in connection with the sympathetic system.</p>

<p>A nerve is a cord consisting of a certain number of fibers of nerve tissue,
inclosed in a sheath of connective tissue. Nerves divide and subdivide, sending
off branches, which ramify in all parts of the body, and, as they near their
terminations, they contain but one or two fibers.</p>

<p>The brain and spinal cord are contained within a bony canal, which forms a
protective covering for them.</p>

<p>The spinal cord, or spinal marrow, lodged within the spinal canal, or hollow
of the backbone, is continuous with the brain anteriorly, and terminates in a
point in the sacrum (that part of the spinal column which immediately precedes
the tail). The spinal cord gives off branches at each of the spaces between the
segments of the backbone. These branches form nerve trunks which carry both
sensory and motor impressions and impulses. The spinal cord is a grand nerve
trunk to carry messages to or from the brain and to and from the reflex centers
contained within itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>The brain is contained within the cavity of the skull and is continuous with
the spinal cord; there is nothing to mark the place where one leaves off and
the other begins. The brain is the seat of reason and intelligence. Voluntary
effort originates from the brain. Coordination, or harmony of movement, is
controlled by the rear portion of the brain, known as the cerebellum.</p>

<p>The meninges are the membranes, three in number, which envelop the brain and
spinal cord, and separate them from the bones which form the walls of the
cranial cavity and spinal canal.</p>

<p>The sympathetic, also called the ganglionic, division of the nervous system
consists of two chains of ganglia, reaching from the head to the tail, situated
beneath the spinal column, one on either side. The presence of the ganglia or
enlargements on the cords give them their chainlike appearance.</p>

<p>The sympathetic nerves are closely connected with the cerebrospinal nerves,
but are not under the control of the will.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES (STAGGERS).</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the brain is technically termed encephalitis and of its
membranes cerebral-meningitis, but as both conditions usually occur together,
and since it is practically impossible to distinguish one from the other by the
symptoms shown by the diseased animal, they may as well be considered together
here as varieties of the same disease. Staggers, coma, frenzy, etc., are terms
that are sometimes applied to this disease in its different forms or stages.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Severe blows on the head with a hard object, or the head
coming violently in contact with the ground or other hard substance in a fall,
may be followed by encephalitis. Irritation caused by tumors in the brain may
produce inflammation. Feed containing deleterious matters&mdash;for example,
ergot (see <a href="#PLATE_V">Pl. V</a>) and other fungi which contain a
narcotic principle&mdash;is the most frequent cause of this affection, and
hence it is often called "grass staggers" and "stomach staggers." Highly
nitrogenous feeds are blamed for causing this disease. Parasites, mineral and
narcotic poisons, hot weather, and severe exertion or excessive excitement may
cause this condition. Inflammation of the brain may occur as a complication of
some infectious disease or may follow some forms of indigestion. In many
localities certain plants have the reputation of causing staggers.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms vary much, but a careful observer will detect a
trouble connected with the nervous system without much uncertainty. The first
signs may be those of frenzy, but generally at the start the animal is dull and
sleepy, with little or no inclination to move about; the head may be pressed
against the wall or fence and the legs kept moving, as if the animal were
endeavoring to walk through the obstruction; the body, especially the hind
part, may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a>
</span>leaned against the side of the stall or stable, as if for support.
The bowels are constipated; the urine, when passed, is small in quantity and
darker in color than natural. There may be trembling and even spasms of muscles
in different parts. In the dull stage the animal may breathe less frequently
than is natural, and each breath may be accompanied with a snoring-like sound.
The pulse may be large and less frequent than normal. If suddenly aroused from
the drowsy state, the animal appears startled and stares wildly. When moving
about it may stagger, the hind quarters swaying from side to side.</p>

<p>If delirium ensues, the cow is commonly said to be mad. She may bellow,
stamp her feet, run about wildly, grate the teeth, froth at the mouth. If she
is confined in the stable, she rears and plunges; the convulsions are so
violent in many instances that it is really dangerous for one to attempt to
render aid. The body may be covered with perspiration. She may fall; the
muscles twitch and jerk; often the head is raised and then dashed against the
ground until blood issues from the nose and mouth; the eyes may be bloodshot
and sightless; the limbs stiff and outstretched, or they may be kicked about
recklessly; the head may be drawn back and the tail drawn up; the urine may be
squirted out in spurts; often the "washer" (membrane nictitans) is forced over
the eye. When the convulsions cease they may be followed by a period of quiet
unconsciousness (coma) which is more or less prolonged, when the animal may
gradually regain consciousness, get up on its feet, and perhaps quietly partake
of food, if there be any within reach, while at other times it arises with much
difficulty and staggers blindly about the stall or field.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that all the foregoing symptoms are not always seen in
the same case. In those cases usually designated "sleepy staggers" the general
symptoms of drowsiness are presented, while in other cases the symptoms of
frenzy cause the affection to be called "mad staggers." In other cases there
are symptoms of paralysis, swaying of the hind quarters, inability to rise,
etc., and sometimes these symptoms of paralysis are the most striking
manifestations and continue until death. Acute cases are accompanied by
fever.</p>

<p>It is well to remark that when the disease follows injuries to the head the
symptoms may not be manifested until two or three days (or longer) after the
accident.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Recoveries are rare in spite of careful attention. To be of
any service whatever the treatment must be prompt and begin with the disease.
In the early stage, when the pulse is large, most cases will admit of bleeding.
Eight or 9 quarts of blood should be taken from the jugular vein. This should
be followed immediately by a purgative, the following for a cow of average
size: Epsom salt, 24 ounces; pulverized gamboge, one-half ounce; croton oil, 20
drops; warm water, 3 quarts; mix all together and give at once as a drench.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
About 2 quarts of warm water or warm soapsuds should be injected with a
syringe into the rectum every three or four hours. It is best to keep the
animal in a quiet, sheltered place, where it will be free from noise or other
cause of excitement. All the cold water the animal will drink should be
allowed, but feed must be withheld, except bran slops occasionally in small
quantities, or grass, if in season, which may be cut and carried fresh to the
patient.</p>

<p>The skull must be examined, and if sign of injury is found, appropriate
surgical treatment should be given.</p>

<p>During the convulsions all possible efforts should be made to prevent the
animal injuring itself. The head should be held down on the ground and straw
kept under it. Cold water may be continuously poured on the head, or bags
filled with ice broken in small pieces may be applied to the head. Different
authors recommend different remedies to allay the convulsions, but for two
reasons it will be found extremely difficult to administer medicines during the
convulsions: (1) While the animal is unconscious the power to swallow is lost,
and therefore the medicine is more liable to go down the windpipe to the lungs
than it is to go to the paunch; (2) the convulsions are often so violent that
it would be utterly useless to attempt to drench the animal; and furthermore it
must be borne in mind that during this stage the functions of digestion and
absorption are suspended, and as a consequence the medicine (provided it finds
its way to the paunch) is likely to remain there unabsorbed and therefore
useless.</p>

<p>A blistering compound, composed of mustard, 1 ounce; pulverized cantharides,
one-half ounce; hot water, 4 ounces, well mixed together, may be rubbed in over
the loins, along the spine, and back of the head on each side of the neck. This
is occasionally attended with beneficial effect, and especially so in those
cases when paralysis is present.</p>

<p>If the purgative acts and the animal shows signs of improvement in the
course of two or three days, 2 drams of iodid of potassium may be given every
night and morning, dissolved in a half bucketful of drinking water, if the
animal will drink it, or it may be dissolved in a half pint of water and given
as a drench. Great care must be observed in regard to the food, which should be
nutritive, but not coarse, and at first in small quantities, gradually
increased as the patient improves. After some progress is made toward recovery
1&frac12; drams of pulverized nux vomica may be given twice a day, added to the
iodid of potassium drench. This should be administered so long as a staggering
gait continues.</p>

<p>In those rare cases when recovery takes place it is only partial as a rule,
as there is generally a sequel which remains, such as partial paralysis.
However, this is but a slight drawback in cattle, because <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>when it is seen to persist
the medicine should be stopped and the animal fattened for butchering.</p>

<p>Post-mortem examinations discover congestion of the brain and its membranes.
In those cases which have exhibited much paralysis of the hind legs before
death the cord may be congested in the lumbar region (loins). When the disease
has been caused by injury to the head, the congestion and extravasated blood
may be found inside of the cavity in the location corresponding to the place
where the injury was inflicted externally. In some cases pus is also
discovered. It remains to be said that in all animals that have died from this
affection the lungs are found very much congested. This may lead the
superficial observer to suppose that the disease was a lung affection, but in
fact it is only a natural consequence when death ensues from brain disease.</p>

<h4>APOPLEXY.</h4>

<p>That form of congestion of the brain known as parturient apoplexy, or
parturient paresis, which is so frequently associated with the period of
calving is described in another part of this work. (See "Milk fever," p.
226.)</p>

<p>Cerebral apoplexy, not connected with parturition, is a rare disease among
cattle. However, it may be due to degeneration and consequent rupture of a
blood vessel in the brain.</p>

<p>The attack is sudden, the animal in most cases falling as if it had received
a blow on the head. It may stagger and reel some time before going down. After
falling, there are convulsive movements of the legs or the animal sinks into
insensibility. There may be remissions in the severity of the symptoms, but the
pressure from the continued escape of blood soon causes death. Rest, quiet,
friction to the legs and surface, frequent turning of the animal and cold to
the head are to be practiced, if treatment is attempted.</p>

<h4>CONGESTION OF THE BRAIN.</h4>

<p>There is a form of congestive apoplexy affecting cattle which are in a
plethoric condition. The congestion, or overfilling with blood, causes pressure
on the brain substance and disorganizes its function. It occurs mostly in hot
weather. In this disease the symptoms are somewhat similar to those exhibited
when the animal has encephalitis, but the onset is more sudden, the duration is
shorter, and there is less fever. There may be frenzy or coma, or alternations
one with the other. The intelligence is diminished, staring eyes, bracing with
the legs, pressing against the stall partition or manger, red mucous membranes.
This condition usually terminates in recovery.</p>

<p>In such cases bleeding should be resorted to immediately, and when the power
of swallowing is not lost purgatives should be ad<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ministered. Cold
applications to the head and the general treatment recommended for encephalitis
are indicated.</p>

<h4>CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN.</h4>

<p>Severe blows on the head, striking the head against some hard object while
running, or falling on the head may cause concussion of the brain. The injury
may fracture bones of the cranium and produce compression of the brain.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms and treatment</em>.&mdash;The symptoms and the treatment that is
indicated differ very little from what has been said under congestion of the
brain and under encephalitis. In some cases it may be necessary to operate to
remove a piece of bone that is pressing on the brain or to remove a clot of
blood under the area which received the blow.</p>

<h4>EPILEPSY.</h4>

<p>This affection is characterized by the occurrence of sudden convulsions. The
animal may appear to be in a fair state of health usually, but at any time, in
the stable or in the field, it may have a convulsion in which it will fall and
lose consciousness. Epilepsy must not be confounded with vertigo&mdash;the
fainting which is an effect of heart troubles.</p>

<p>The exact cause of epilepsy in the majority of cases is unknown. Post-mortem
examinations in many instances have failed to discover any lesion in connection
with the brain or nervous system, while in other instances disease of the brain
has been found in the form of thickening of the membranes, abscesses, and
tumors, and in some cases the affection has been manifested in connection with
a diseased condition of the blood. The cause has also been traced to reflex
irritation, due to teething, worms, and chronic indigestion.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When the affection is due to the last-named causes
treatment may be successful if the cause is removed. If there are symptoms of
worms or of indigestion, follow the general treatment advised for those
troubles under their proper heads. If due to irritation caused by teething, the
inflamed gums must be lanced. Examination of the mouth often develops the fact
that one of the temporary teeth causes much irritation by remaining unshed, and
thereby interfering with the growth of a permanent tooth. The offending tooth
should be extracted. When the cause of epilepsy can not be discovered, it must
be confessed that there is no prospect of a cure. However, some benefit may be
expected from the occasional administration of a purgative dose of medicine. A
pound of Epsom salt dissolved in a quart of warm water, for a cow of average
size, may be given as a drench once or twice a month. In addition to the
purgative, 4 drams of bromid of potassium, dissolved in the drinking water,
three times a day, has proved very beneficial in some cases.

<h4>SUNSTROKE (PROSTRATION FROM HEAT).</h4>

<p>Owing to the fact that cattle are seldom put to work at which they would
have to undergo severe exertion, especially in collars, they are not frequently
prostrated by the extreme heat of the summer months. When at pasture they
select the coolest places in the shade of trees, in water, etc., when the heat
becomes oppressive, and thereby avoid, as much as possible, the effects of
it.</p>

<p>It does happen, however, that cattle that have been kept up for the purpose
of fattening, when driven some distance in very hot weather, are sometimes
prostrated, but it must be remembered that it is not really necessary for the
animal to be exposed to the rays of the sun, as those confined in hot, close
places may suffer. This often happens in shipping, when they are crowded
together in cars.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The premonitory signs are those of
exhaustion&mdash;dullness, panting, frothing at the mouth, tongue hanging out,
irregular gait, uneasiness, palpitation&mdash;when, if the circumstances which
tend to the prostration are not mitigated, the animal staggers or sways from
side to side, falls, struggles for a while, and then gradually becomes quiet,
or the struggles may continue, with repeated but ineffectual efforts to regain
a standing position. In serious cases the attack may be very sudden,
unconsciousness occurring without continued or distressing premonitory
symptoms.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;At first, when not very serious, removal to a quiet,
sheltered place, with a few days on a reduced diet, is all that need be done.
When the animal has fallen, apply cold water or ice to the head; rub the body
and limbs with cloths or wisps of straw and continue the rubbing for a
considerable time. If the power of swallowing is not lost (which may be
ascertained by pouring a little cold water into the mouth), give 3 drams of
stronger liquor ammonia, diluted with a quart of cold water. Be very careful in
drenching the animal when lying down. Repeat the drench in a half hour and an
hour after the first one has been given. Instead of the ammonia, a drench
composed of 3 ounces of spirits of nitrous ether in a pint of water may be
given, if more convenient, but the ammonia drench is preferable. If
unconsciousness continues, so that a drench can not be administered, the same
quantity of ammonia and water may be injected with a syringe into the rectum.
The popular aqua ammonia, commonly called "hartshorn," will do as well as the
stronger liquor ammonia, but as it is weaker than the latter the dose for a cow
is about 1&frac12; ounces, which should be diluted with a quart of water before it
is given to the animal, either as a drench or an enema. When ammonia can not be
obtained, an ounce of tincture of digitalis may be given.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the animal is able to rise it should be assisted and moved to the
nearest shelter. All the cold water it will drink should be allowed. The
ammonia or spirits of nitrous ether drench should be administered every three
hours so long as there is much failure of strength. The diet should be limited
for several days&mdash;bran slops and a little grass. When signs of returning
strength are presented, 12 ounces of Epsom salt dissolved in a quart of warm
water may be given in those cases which have been down and unconscious, but do
not give it while much weakness remains, which may be for several days after
the attack. The flesh of an animal that is suffering from heat stroke should
not be prepared for use as food. On account of the fever with which the animal
suffers, the flesh contains toxins that may render it poisonous to the
consumer.</p>

<h4>INJURIES TO THE SPINAL CORD.</h4>

<p>The spinal cord is liable to concussion from blows and falls, and paralysis,
to a greater or less extent, may be the result. Fracture, with displacement of
the bones (vertebrÃ¦) which form the spinal column, by compressing the spinal
cord, produces paralysis, which varies in its effect according to the part of
the cord that is compressed. If the fracture is above the middle of the neck,
death soon follows, as communication between the brain and diaphragm (the
essential muscle of inspiration) is stopped. When the fracture is farther down
in the neck, posterior to the origin of the phrenic nerve, the breathing
continues, but there is paralysis in all parts posterior to the fracture,
including the fore and hind legs. When the fracture is in the region of the
loins the hind legs are paralyzed, but the fore legs are not. If the fracture
is in the sacrum (the division of the spinal column between the loins and the
tail), the tail alone is paralyzed.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, when the back is broken there is no remedy; the
animal should be killed at once.</p>

<h4>PARALYSIS.</h4>

<p>Paralysis, or loss of motion in a part, may be due to a lesion of the brain,
of the spinal cord, or of a nerve. It may also be caused by reflex irritation.
When the paralysis affects both sides of the body, posterior to a point, it is
further designated by the name paraplegia. When one side of the body (a lateral
half) is paralyzed, the term hemiplegia is applied to the affection. When
paralysis is caused by a lesion of a nerve, the paralysis is confined to the
particular part supplied by the affected nerve.</p>

<p>As already pointed out, paralysis may be due to concussion of the spine,
fracture of a bone of the spinal column with consequent com<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>pression of the spinal
cord, concussion of the brain, or compression of the brain. An injury to one
side of the brain may produce paralysis of the same side of the head and of the
opposite side of the body (hemiplegia). Paralysis may occur in connection with
parturient apoplexy, lead poisoning, ergotism, etc.</p>

<h4>CONGESTION OF THE SPINAL CORD.</h4>

<p>Paraplegia, or paralysis of the rear part of the body, is the dominant
symptom in congestion or inflammation of the spinal cord. The cause is not
known, but the disease is probably due to chilling. It is thought by some that
some toxic influence (poison) may be responsible for its development.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms usually appear suddenly and consist in
inability to stand. Sometimes this is preceded by a period of excitement. The
animal usually lies quietly, but sometimes it groans and tosses its head about
in a way that indicates pain. Cows heavy with calf are sometimes affected with
a form of paraplegia, which usually attacks them from about a month to a few
days before calving. Apparently they are in good health in every respect except
the inability to stand up on account of the paralysis of the hind quarters.
This form is generally attributed to feeding on feeds containing insufficient
protein and ash. It is most likely to occur in cows that are weak and thin.
With good care and feed recovery usually occurs.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The animal must be given a soft, dry bed under shelter and
in a quiet, airy place. It is well to apply mustard along the spine. The action
of the mustard may be intensified by rubbing the skin with ammonia or
turpentine. Internally give a purge of Glauber's salt. Nux vomica or strychnia
(1 to 2 grain doses) may be given. Turn the cow two to four times daily and rub
the legs well each time.</p>

<p>There are instances when cows will persist in lying down (in spite of all
efforts that are made to compel them to stand up), when it can not really be
said that they are paralyzed. They have sensation in all parts; they can move
all their feet; they can change their position; and in fact every function
seems to be normally performed, but they obstinately refuse to rise or even
make an effort to do so. Cases of this kind have been killed, as it was an
utter impossibility to get the animal on its feet. However, there are instances
when a cow, after refusing to rise when all other means had been tried, quickly
jumped to her feet and showed fright upon the appearance of a dog or other
terrifying object.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h4>RABIES (HYDROPHOBIA).</h4>

<p>[See discussion of this disease in chapter on "Infectious diseases," p.
358.]</p>

<h4>LIGHTNING STROKE (ASPHYXIA ELECTRICA).</h4>

<p>When an animal is struck by lightning the shock is instantaneously expended
on the nervous system, and as a rule death occurs immediately; but when the
shock is not fatal animation is suspended to a greater or less extent, as
evidenced by prostration, unconsciousness, and paralysis.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;When not fatal, the symptoms vary much, according to the
severity of the shock. The animal usually falls, as from an apoplectic attack,
and, as a matter of course, the symptoms are such as are generally manifested
in connection with concussion of the brain. The muscular system may be
completely relaxed; the legs limber; the muscles flabby and soft to the touch;
or there may be convulsions, spasms, and twitching of the muscles. The
breathing is generally labored, irregular, or interrupted, and slower than
normal. In most instances the electrical fluid leaves its mark by singeing the
hair, or by inflicting wounds, burns, or blisters.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;So long as the beating of the heart is perceptible the
endeavor to resuscitate the animal should be continued. Dash cold water over
the head and body; rub the body and legs; smartly whip the body with wet towels
or switches. Mustard, mixed with water, should be well rubbed over the legs and
back of the head on each side of the neck. Inject into the rectum 4 drams of
stronger liquor ammonia, or 1&frac12; ounces of hartshorn diluted with a quart of
warm water. Cautiously hold an uncorked bottle of hartshorn to the nostrils, so
that some of it is inhaled, but care should be taken that too much is not
suddenly inhaled. If the animal is unconscious, hypodermic injections of
stimulants are indicated, such as 6 drams of camphorated oil in one dose,
subcutaneously, or 20 grains of caffein or &frac12; grain of strychnin, also
subcutaneously.</p>

<p>When the animal revives sufficiently to be able to swallow, 4 drams of the
stronger liquor ammonia, diluted with a quart of cold water, should be given as
a drench, and the dose should be repeated in an hour. One and one-half ounces
of ordinary hartshorn may be used instead of the stronger liquor ammonia, but,
like the latter, it should be diluted with a quart or more of water, and even
then care should be exercised in drenching.</p>

<p>In cases where the shock has not caused complete insensibility recovery may
be hastened by the ammonia and water drench, or 4 ounces of brandy diluted with
a quart of water, or 8 ounces of whisky diluted with a quart of water. These
doses may be given every three or four hours if necessary. After recovery from
the more serious symptoms 2 drams of sulphate of quinin should be given twice a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
day until health is restored. If any paralysis remains 1&frac12; drams of
pulverized nux vomica should be given twice a day with the quinin.</p>

<p>The foregoing treatment is also applicable when the electrical shock is
given by telephone, electric car, or electric-light wires, etc. The wounds,
burns, or blisters should be treated according to the antiseptic method of
treating wounds.</p>

<h4>TUMORS IN THE BRAIN, ETC.</h4>

<p>Tumors of different kinds have been found within the cranial cavity, and in
many cases there have been no well-marked symptoms exhibited during the life of
the animal to lead one to suspect their existence. Cases are recorded where
bony tumors have been found in the brain of cattle that died suddenly, but
during life no signs of disease were manifested. Post-mortem examinations have
disclosed tubercles in the membranes of the brain. (See "Tuberculosis," p.
407.) Abscesses, usually the result of inflammation of the brain, have been
found post-mortem. For the description of hydrocephalus, or dropsy of the
brain, of calves the reader is referred to the section on parturition. (See
"Water in the head," <a href="#Page_179">p. 179</a>.)</p>

<p>Chorea, constant twitching and irregular spasmodic movements of the muscles,
has been noticed in connection with or as a sequel to other affections, as, for
example, parturient apoplexy.</p>

<p>Various diseases, the description of which will be found in other sections
of this work, affect the nervous system to a greater or less extent&mdash;for
example, ergotism, lead poisoning, uremia, parturient apoplexy, colic, and
other affections associated with cramps, or spasms, etc. Disease of the ovaries
or of the spinal cord, by reflex irritation, may cause estromania (see "Excess
of venereal desire," <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>, constant desire for the bull).</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_URINARY_ORGANS"
id="DISEASES_OF_THE_URINARY_ORGANS"></a>DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">James Law, F. R. C. V. S.</span>,</h3>

<h5><em>Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University</em>.</h5>

<p>Of the materials that have served their purpose in building up the animal
body or in sustaining the body temperature, and that are now to be thrown out
as waste, the greater part is expelled from the system through the lungs and
the kidneys, but the agents that pass out by either of these two channels
differ in the main from those passing by the other. Thus from the lungs in the
form of dioxid of carbon&mdash;the same gas that comes from burning of coal or
oil&mdash;there escapes most of the waste material resulting from the
destruction in the system of fats, sugars, starch, and such other foods as are
wanting in the element nitrogen, and do not form fibrous tissues, but go mainly
to support animal heat or maintain functional activity. From the kidneys, on
the other hand, are thrown out the waste products resulting from the
destruction of the foods and tissues containing nitrogen&mdash;of, for
instance, albumin, fibrin, gluten, casein, gelatin, woody tissue, etc. While
much of the waste material containing nitrogen leaves the body by the bowels,
this is virtually only such of the albuminoid food as has failed to be fully
digested and absorbed; this has never formed a true constituent part of the
body itself or of the blood, but is so much waste food, like that which has
come to the table and again carried away unused. If the albuminoid food element
has entered the blood, whether or not it has been built up into a constituent
part of the structure of the body, its waste products, which contain nitrogen,
are in the main expelled through the kidneys, so that the latter become the
principal channels for the expulsion of all nitrogen-containing waste.</p>

<p>It would be an error, however, to infer that all nitrogenous food, when once
digested and absorbed into the blood, must necessarily leave the system in the
urine. On the contrary, in the young and growing animal, all increase of the
fibrous structures of the body is gained through the building up of those
flesh-forming constituents into their substance; in the pregnant animal the
growth of the offspring and its envelopes has a similar origin, and in the
dairy cow the casein or curd of the milk is a means of constant elimination of
these nitrogen-containing agents. Thus, in the breeding cow and, above all, in
the milking cow, the womb or udder carries on a work in one sense equivalent to
that otherwise performed by the kidneys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> Not only are these organs alike
channels for the excretion of albuminous products, but they are also
related to each other structurally and by nervous sympathy, so that suffering
in the one is liable to induce some measure of disorder in the other.</p>

<p>As in the case of other mammals, this nitrogenous waste matter is mainly
present in the urine of cattle in the form of urea, but also, to some extent,
as hippuric acid, a derivative of vegetable food which, in the herbivora,
replaces the uric acid found in the urine of man and carnivora. Uric acid is,
however, found in the urine of sucking calves which have practically an animal
diet, and it may also appear in the adult in case of absolute, prolonged
starvation, and in diseases attended with complete loss of appetite and rapid
wasting of the body. In such cases the animal lives on its own substance, and
the product is that of the wasting flesh.</p>

<p>The other products containing nitrogen are present in only small quantities
and need not be specially referred to. The urine of cattle contains much less
of carbonates than that of the horse, and effervesces less on the addition of
an acid. As the carbonates form a large proportion of the solid deposits
(gravel, stone) from the horse's urine, the ox may thus be held less liable,
yet even in the ox the carbonates become abundant or scanty, according to the
nature of the feed, and therefore gravel, formed by carbonate of lime, is not
infrequent in cattle. When fed on beets, clover hay, or bean straw carbonates
are present in large quantities, these aliments being rich in organic acids and
alkaline carbonates; whereas upon oat straw, barley straw, and, above all,
wheat straw, they are in small amount. In calves fed on milk alone no
carbonates are found in the urine.</p>

<p>Phosphates, usually in combination with lime, are, as a rule, present only
in traces in the urine of cattle; however, on a dietary of wheat, bran, or
other aliment rich in phosphates, these may be present in large amount, so that
they render the liquid cloudy or are deposited in solid crystals. The liquid is
rendered transparent by nitric acid.</p>

<p>The varying quantity of urea (from 1.6 to 15.4 ounces) is most suggestive as
to the action of the more or less nitrogenous feed and the resulting
concentration of the urine and blood. Hippuric acid, on the other hand, is most
abundant when the animal is fed on hay and straw.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of the urine of cattle varies from 1,030 to 1,060 in
health, water being 1,000. It is transparent, with a yellowish tinge, and has a
characteristic, musky smell. The chemical reaction is alkaline, turning red
litmus paper blue. The quantity passed in twenty-four hours varies greatly,
increasing not only with the water drunk, but with the albuminoids taken in
with the feed and the urea produced. If a solution of urea is injected into the
veins the secretion of urine is greatly augmented. Similarly the excess of
salts like carbonate of potash in the feed, or of sugar, increases the action
of the kidneys. Only about 20 per cent of the water swallowed escapes in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> the urine, the remaining 80 per cent passing
mostly from the lungs, and to a slight extent by the bowels. The skin of the
ox does not perspire so readily nor so freely as that of the horse; hence the
kidneys and lungs are called upon for extra work. The influence of an excess
of water in the feed is most remarkable in swill-fed distillery cattle, which
urinate profusely and frequently, yet thrive and fatten rapidly.</p>

<p>Among the other conditions that increase the flow of urine is overfilling of
(internal pressure in) the blood vessels of the kidneys; hence the contraction
of the blood vessels of the skin by cold drives the blood inward, tends to
dilate the blood vessels of the kidneys, and to increase the secretion of
urine. Nervous disorders, such as excitement, fear, congestions, or structural
injuries to the back part of the base of the brain, have a similar result,
hence, doubtless, the action of certain fungi growing in musty hay or oats in
producing profuse flow of urine, whereas other forms of musty fodder cause
stupor, delirium, or paralysis. Bacteria and their products are mainly expelled
by the kidneys, and become sources of local infection, irritation, and
disease.</p>

<p>The quantity of urine passed daily by an ox on dry feeding averages 7 to 12
pints, but this may be increased enormously on a watery diet.</p>

<p>The mutual influence of the kidneys and other important organs tends to
explain the way in which disease in one part supervenes on preexisting disorder
in another. The introduction of albuminoids in excess into the blood means the
formation of an excess of urea, and a more profuse secretion of urine, of a
higher specific gravity, and with a greater tendency to deposit its solid
constituents, as gravel, in the kidneys or bladder. A torpid action of the
liver, leaving the albuminoids in transition forms, less soluble than the urea
into which they should have been changed, favors the onset of rheumatism or of
nervous disorder, the deposit of such albuminoid products in the kidneys, the
formation of a deep-brown or reddish urine, and congestion of the kidneys. Any
abnormal activity of the liver in the production of sugar&mdash;more than can
be burned up in the circulation&mdash;overstimulates the kidneys and produces
increased flow of a heavy urine with a sweetish taste. This increased
production of sugar may be primarily due to disease of the brain, which, in its
turn, determines the disorder of the liver. Disease of the right side of the
heart or of the lungs, by obstructing the onward flow of blood from the
veins, increases the blood pressure in the kidneys and produces disorder and
excessive secretion. Inactivity of the kidneys determines an increase in the
blood of waste products, which become irritating to different parts, producing
skin eruptions, itching, dropsies, and nervous disorders. Sprains of the loins
produce bleeding from the ki<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
117]</a></span>dneys and disease of the spinal cord, and sometimes
determine albuminous or milky looking urine.</p>

<p>The kidney of the ox (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig. 1) is a compound
organ made up of 15 to 25 separate lobules like so many separate kidneys, but
all pouring their secretion into one common pouch (pelvis) situated in an
excavation in the center of the lower surface. While the ox is the only
domesticated quadruped which maintains this divided condition of the kidney
after birth, this condition is common to all while at an early stage of
development in the womb. The cluster of lobules making up a single kidney forms
an ovoid mass flattened from above downward, and extending from the last rib
backward beneath the loins and to one side of the solid chain of the backbone.
The right is more firmly attached to the loins and extends farther backward
than the left. Deeply covered in a mass of suet, each kidney has a strong
outer, white, fibrous covering, and inside this two successive layers of kidney
substance, of which the outer is that in which the urine is mainly separated
from the blood and poured into the fine, microscopic urinary ducts.
(<a href="#PLATE_X">Pl. X</a>, fig. 1) These latter, together with blood vessels,
lymph vessels, and nerves, make up the second, or internal, layer. The outer
layer is mainly composed of minute globular clusters of microscopic,
intercommunicating blood vessels (Malpighian bodies), each of which is
furnished with a fibrous capsule that is nothing else than the dilated
commencement of a urine tube. These practically microscopic tubes follow at
first a winding course through the outer layer (Ferrein's tubes), then form a
long loop (doubling on itself) in the inner layer (Henle's loop), and finally
pass back through the inner layer (Bellini's tubes) to open through a conical
process into the common pouch (pelvis) on the lower surface of the organ.
(<a href="#PLATE_X">Pl. X</a>, figs. 1, 2, 3.)</p>

<p>The tube that conveys the urine from the kidney to the bladder is
like a white, round cord, about the size of a goose quill, prolonged from the
pouch on the lower surface of the kidney backward beneath the loins, then
inward, supported by a fold of thin membrane, to open into the bladder just in
front of its neck. The canal passes first through the middle (muscular) coat of
the bladder, and then advances perceptibly between that and the internal
(mucous) coat, through which it finally opens. By this arrangement in
overfilling the bladder this opening is closed like a valve by the pressure of
the urine, and the return of liquid to the kidney is prevented. The bladder
(<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig. 2) is a dilatable, egg-shaped pouch, closed
behind by a strong ring of muscular fibers encircling its neck, and enveloped
by looped, muscular fibers extending on all sides around its body and closed
anterior end. Stimulated by the presence of urine, these last contract and
expel contents through the neck into the urethra. This last is the tube leading
backward along the floor of the pelvic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>bones and downward through the penis. In
the bull this canal of the urethra is remarkable for its small caliber and for
the S-shaped bend which it describes in the space between the thighs and just
above the scrotum. This bend is attributable to the fact that the retractor
muscles are attached to the penis at this point, and in withdrawing that organ
within its sheath they double it upon itself. The small size of the canal and
this S-shaped bend are serious obstacles to the passing of a catheter to draw
the urine, yet by extending the penis out of its sheath the bend is effaced,
and a small, gum-elastic catheter, not more than one-fourth of an inch in
diameter, may with care be passed into the bladder. In the cow the urethra is
very short, opening in the median line on the floor of the vulva about 4 inches
in front of its external orifice. Even in her, however, the passing of a
catheter is a matter of no little difficulty, the opening of the urethra being
very narrow and encircled by the projecting membranous and rigid margins, and
on each side of the opening is a blind pouch (canal of GÃ¤rtner) into which the
catheter will almost invariably find its way. In both male and female,
therefore, the passing of a catheter is an operation which demands special
skill.</p>

<p><em>General symptoms of urinary disorders</em>.&mdash;These are not so prominent in
cattle as in horses, yet they are of a similar kind. There is a stiff or
straddling gait with the hind legs and some difficulty in turning or in lying
down and rising, the act causing a groan. The frequent passage of urine in
driblets, its continuous escape in drops, the sudden arrest of the flow when in
full stream, the rhythmic contraction of the muscles under the anus without any
flow resulting, the swelling of the sheath, the collection of hard, gritty
masses on the hair surrounding the orifice of the sheath, the occurrence of
dropsies in the limbs under the chest or belly, or in either of these cavities,
and finally the appearance of nervous stupor, may indicate serious disorder of
the urinary organs. The condition of the urine passed may likewise lead to
suspicion. It may be white, from crystallized carbonate of lime; brown, red, or
even black, from the presence of blood or blood-coloring matter; yellow, from
biliary coloring matter; frothy, from contained albumin; cloudy, from
phosphates; glairy, from pus; it may also show gritty masses from gravel. In
many cases of urinary disorder in the ox, however, the symptoms are by no means
prominent, and unless special examination is made of the loins, the bladder,
and the urine the true nature of the malady may be overlooked.</p>

<h4>DIURESIS (POLYURIA, DIABETES INSIPIDUS, EXCESSIVE SECRETION OF URINE).</h4>

<p>A secretion of urine in excess of the normal amount may be looked on as
disease, even if the result does not lead to immediate loss of condition.
Cattle fed on distillery swill are striking examples of such <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>excess caused by
the enormous consumption of a liquid feed, which nourishes and fattens in spite
of the diuresis; the condition is unwholesome, and cattle that have passed four
or five months in a swill stable have fatty livers and kidneys, and never again
do well on ordinary feed. Diuresis may further occur from increase of blood
pressure in the kidneys (diseases of the heart or lungs which hinder the onward
passage of the blood, the eating of digitalis, English broom, the contraction
of the blood vessels on the surface of the body in cold weather, etc.); also
from acrid or diuretic plants taken with the feed (dandelion, burdock,
colchicum, digitalis, savin, resinous shoots, etc.); from excess of sugar in
the feed (beets, turnips, ripe sorghum); also from the use of frozen feed
(frosted turnip tops and other vegetables), and from the growths of certain
molds in fodder (musty hay, mow-burnt hay, moldy oats, moldy bread, etc.).
Finally, alkaline waters and alkaline incrustations on the soil may be active
causes. In some of these cases the result is beneficial rather than injurious,
as when cattle affected with gravel in the kidneys are entirely freed from this
condition by a run at grass, or by an exclusive diet of roots or swill. In
other cases, however, the health and condition suffer, and even inflammation of
the kidneys may occur.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment is mainly in the change of diet to a more
solid aliment destitute of the special, offensive ingredient. Boiled flaxseed
is often the best diet or addition to the wholesome dry food, and, by way of
medicine, doses of 2 drams each of sulphate of iron and iodid of potassium may
be given twice daily. In obstinate cases 2 drams ergot of rye or of catechu may
be added.</p>

<h4>BLOODY URINE (RED WATER, MOOR ILL, WOOD ILL, HEMATURIA,
HEMAGLOBINURIA).</h4>

<p>This is a common affection among cattle in certain localities, above all on
damp, undrained lands and under a backward agriculture. It is simply bloody
urine or hematuria when the blood is found in clots, or when under the
microscope the blood globules can be detected as distinctly rounded, flattened
disks. It is smoky urine&mdash;hemaglobinuria&mdash;when neither such distinct
clots nor blood disks can be found, but merely a general browning, reddening,
or blackening of the urine by the presence of dissolved, blood-coloring matter.
The bloody urine is the more direct result of structural disease of the kidneys
or urinary passages (inflammation, stone, gravel, tumors, hydatids, kidney
worms, sprains of the loins), while the stained urine (hemaglobinuria) is
usually the result of some general or more distinct disorder in which the
globules are destroyed in the circulating blood and the coloring matter
dissolved in and diffused through the whole mass of the blood and of the urine
secreted from it. As in the two forms, blood and the elements of blood escape
into the urine, albumin is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">
[Pg 120]</a></span>always present, so that there is albuminuria with
blood-coloring matter superadded. If from stone or gravel, gritty particles are
usually passed, and may be detected in the bottom of a dish in which the liquid
is caught. If from fracture or severe sprain of the loins, it is liable to be
associated not only with some loss of control of the hind limbs and with
staggering behind but also with a more or less perfect paralysis of the tail.
The bloodstained urine without red globules results from specific
diseases&mdash;Texas fever (<a href="#PLATE_XLVII">Pl. XLVII</a>, fig. 3),
anthrax, spirillosis, and from eating irritant plants (broom, savin, mercury,
hellebore, ranunculus, convolvulus, colchicum, oak shoots, ash privet, hazel,
hornbeam, and other astringent, acrid, or resinous plants, etc.). The Maybug or
Spanish fly taken with the feed or spread over a great extent of skin as a
blister has a similar action. Frosted turnips or other roots will bring on the
affection in some subjects. Among conditions which act by the direct
destruction of the globules in the circulating blood may be named an excess of
water in that fluid; the use of water from soils rich in decomposing vegetable
matter and containing alkaline salts, particularly nitrites; and the presence
in the water and feed of the ptomaines of bacteria growth; hence the prevalence
of "red water" in marshy districts and on clayey and other impervious soils,
and the occurrence of bloody urine in the advanced stages of several contagious
diseases. Some mineral poisons&mdash;such as iodin, arsenic, and phosphorus
taken to excess&mdash;may cause hematuria, and finally the symptoms may be
merely the result of a constitutional predisposition of the individual or
family to bleeding. In some predisposed subjects, exposure of the body to cold
or wet will cause the affection.</p>

<p>The specific symptom of bloody or smoky water is a very patent one. It may
or may not be associated with fever, with the presence or absence of abdominal
tenderness on pressure, with a very frothy state of the milk or even a reddish
tinge, with or without marked paleness of the mucous membranes, and general
weakness. When direct injury to the kidneys is the immediate cause of the
disease the urine will be passed often, in small quantity at a time, and with
much straining. When there is bloodlessness (a watery blood) from insufficient
nourishment, fever is absent and the red water is at first the only symptom.
When the active cause has been irritant plants, abdominal tenderness, colics,
and other signs of bowel inflammation are marked features.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment varies according as the cause has been a direct
irritant operating on a subject in vigorous health or a microbian poison acting
on an animal deficient in blood and vigor. In the first form of red water a
smart purgative (1 pound to 1&frac12; pounds Glauber's salt) will clear away the
irritants from the bowels and allay the coexistent high fever. It will also
serve to divert to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">
[Pg 121]</a></span>bowels much of the irritant products already absorbed
into the blood and will thus protect the kidneys. In many such cases a liberal
supply of wholesome, easily digestible feed will be all the additional
treatment required. In this connection demulcent feed (boiled flaxseed, wheat
bran) is especially good. If much blood has been lost, bitters (gentian,
one-half ounce) and iron (sulphate of iron, 2 drams) should be given for a
week.</p>

<p>For cases in which excess of diuretic plants has been taken, it may be well
to replace the salts by 1 to 2 pints of olive oil, adding 1 ounce of laudanum
and 2 drams of gum camphor; also to apply fomentations or a fresh sheepskin
over the loins. Buttermilk or vinegar, one-half pint, or sulphuric acid, 60
drops in a pint of water, may also be used frequently as injections. In cases
caused by sprained or fractured loins, inflamed kidneys, stone or gravel, the
treatment will be as for the particular disease in question.</p>

<p>In hematuria from anemia (watery blood), whether from insufficient or badly
adjusted rations or from the poisonous products of fermentations in impervious
or marshy soils, the treatment must be essentially tonic and stimulating. Rich,
abundant, and easily digestible feed must be furnished. The different grains
(oats, barley, wheat, bran, rye) and seeds (rape, linseed, cotton seed) are
especially called for and may be given either ground or boiled. As a bitter,
sulphate of quinin, one-half dram, and tincture of chlorid of iron, 2 drams,
may be given in a pint of water thrice a day. In some cases 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls
of oil of turpentine twice daily in milk will act favorably.</p>

<p>In this anemic variety prevention is the great need. The drainage and
cultivation of the dangerous soils is the main object. Until this can be
accomplished young and newly purchased cattle not yet inured to the poisons
must be kept from the dangerous fields and turned on only those which are
already drained naturally or artificially. Further, they should have an
abundant ration in which the local product of grass, hay, etc., is supplemented
by grain or other seeds. Another point to be guarded against is the supply of
water that has drained from marshes or impervious soils, rich in organic
matter, as such water is charged with nitrites, ptomaines, etc., which directly
conduce to the disorder. Fence out from all such waters and supply from living
springs or deep wells only.</p>

<h4>ALBUMIN IN THE URINE (ALBUMINURIA).</h4>

<p>In bloody urine albumin is always present as an important constituent of the
blood, and in congested and inflamed kidneys it is present as a part of the
inflammatory exudate. Apart from these, albumin in the urine represents in
different cases a variety of diseased conditions of the kidneys or of distant
organs. Among the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a>
</span>additional causes of albuminuria may be named: (1) An excess
of albumin in the blood (after easy calving with little loss of blood and
before the secretion of milk has been established, or in cases of sudden
suppression of the secretion of milk); (2) under increase of blood pressure
(after deep drinking, after doses of digitalis or broom, after transfusion of
blood from one animal to another, or in disease of the heart or lungs causing
obstruction to the flow of blood from the veins); (3) after cutting (or
disease) of the motor nerves of the vessels going to the kidneys, causing
congestion of these organs; (4) violent exertion, hence long drives; the same
happens with violent, muscular spasms, as from strychnia poisoning, lockjaw,
epilepsy, and convulsions; (5) in most fevers and extensive inflammations of
important organs, like the lungs or liver, the escape of the albumin being
variously attributed to the high temperature of the body and disorder of the
nerves, and to resulting congestion and disorder of the secreting cells of the
kidneys; (6) in burns and some other congested states of the skin; (7) under
the action of certain poisons (strong acids, phosphorous, arsenic, Spanish
flies, carbolic acid, and those inducing bloody urine); (8) in certain
conditions of weakness or congestion of the secreting cells of the kidneys, so
that they allow this element of the blood to escape; (9) when the feed is
entirely wanting in common salt, albumin may appear in the urine
temporarily after a full meal containing an excess of albumin. It can also be
produced experimentally by puncturing the back part of the base of the brain
(the floor of the fourth ventricle close to the point the injury to which
causes sugary urine). In abscess, tumor, or inflammation of the bladder,
ureter, or urethra the urine is albuminous.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that albumin in the urine does not indicate the
existence of any one specific disease, and except when from weakness or loss of
function of the kidney cells, it must be looked on as an attendant on another
disease, the true nature of which we must try to find out. These affections we
must exclude one by one until we are left to assume the noninflammatory
disorder of the secreting cells of the kidney. It is especially important to
exclude inflammation of the kidney, and to do this may require a microscopic
examination of the sediment of the urine and the demonstration of the entire
absence of casts of the uriniferous tubes. (See "Nephritis," <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>.)</p>

<p>To detect albumin in the urine, the suspected and frothy liquid must be
rendered sour by adding a few drops of nitric acid and then boiled in a test
tube. If a solid precipitate forms, then a few more drops of nitric acid should
be added, and if the liquid does not clear it up it is albumin. A precipitate
thrown down by boiling and redissolved by nitric acid is probably phosphate of
lime.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is usually directed to the disease on which it is
dependent. In the absence of any other recognizable disease, mucilaginous
drinks of boiled flaxseed, slippery elm, or gum may be given, tannic acid,
one-half dram twice daily, and fomentations or even mustard poultices over the
loins. When the disease is chronic and there is no attendant fever (elevation
of temperature), tonics (hydrochloric acid, 6 drops in a pint of water;
phosphate of iron, 2 drams, or sulphate of quinin, 2 drams, repeated twice
daily) may be used. In all cases the patient should be kept carefully from cold
and wet, a warm, dry shed, or in warm weather a dry, sunny yard or pasture
being especially desirable.</p>

<h4>SUGAR IN URINE (DIABETES MELLITUS).</h4>

<p>This is a frequent condition of the urine in parturition fever, but as a
specific disease, associated with deranged liver or brain, it is
practically unknown in cattle. As a mere attendant on another disease it
demands no special notice here.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS (NEPHRITIS).</h4>

<p>This has been divided according as it affects the different parts of the
kidneys, as: (1) Its fibrous covering (perinephritis); (2) the secreting tissue
of its outer portion (parenchymatous); (3) the connective tissue
(interstitial); (4) the lining membrane of its ducts (catarrhal); and (5) its
pelvis or sac receiving the urine (pyelitis). It has also been distinguished
according to the changes that take place in the kidney, especially as seen
after death, according to the quantity of albumin in the urine, and according
as the affection is acute or chronic. For the purpose of this work it will be
convenient to consider these as one inflammatory disease, making a distinction
merely between the acute and the chronic or of long standing.</p>

<p>The <em>Causes</em> are in the main like those causing bloody urine, such as irritant
and diuretic plants, Spanish flies applied as a blister or otherwise, exposure
to cold and wet, the presence of stone or gravel in the kidneys, injuries to
the back or loins, as by riding one another, the drinking of alkaline or
selenitic water, the use of putrid, stagnant water, of that containing bacteria
and their products, the consumption of musty fodder, etc.
(See "Hematuria," <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>.)</p>

<p>The length of the loins in cattle predisposes these parts to mechanical
injury, and in the lean and especially in the thin, working ox the kidney is
very liable to suffer. In the absence of an abundance of loose, connective
tissue and of fat, the kidneys lie in close contact with the muscles of the
loins, and any injury to them may tend to stretch the kidney and its vessels,
or to cause its inflammation by direct extension of the disease from the
injured muscle to the adjacent kidney. Thus, under unusually heavy draft, under
slips or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a>
</span>falls on slippery ground, under sudden unexpected drooping or twisting
of the loins from missteps or from the feet sinking into holes, under the
loading and jarring of the loins when animals ride one another in cases of
"heat," the kidneys are subject to injury and inflammation. A hard run, as when
chased by a dog, may be the occasion of such an attack. A fodder rich in
nitrogenous or flesh-forming elements (beans, peas, vetches (<em>Vicia sativa</em>), and
other leguminous plants) has been charged with irritating the kidneys through
the excess of urea, hippuric acid, and allied products eliminated through these
organs and the tendency to the formation of gravel. It seems, however, that
these feeds are most dangerous when partially ripened and yet not fully
matured, a stage of growth at which they are liable to contain ingredients
irritating to the stomach and poisonous to the brain, as seen in their inducing
so-called "stomach staggers." Even in the poisoning by the seeds of ripened but
only partially cured rye grass (<em>Lolium perenne</em>), and darnel (<em>Lolium
temulentum</em>), the kidneys are found violently congested with black blood; also, in
the indigestions that result from the eating of partially ripened corn or
millet some congestion of the kidneys is an attendant phenomenon.</p>

<p>Cruzel says that the disease as occurring locally is usually not alone from
the acrid and resinous plants charged with inducing hematuria, but also from
stinking camomile (<em>Anthemis cotula</em>) and field poppy when used in the fresh,
succulent condition; also from the great prevalence of dead caterpillars on the
pasture, or from dead Spanish flies in the stagnant pools of water. The fresh
plants are believed to be injurious only by reason of a volatile oil which is
dissipated in drying. In the case of the stagnant water it may be questioned
whether the chemical products of the contained ferments (bacteria) are not more
frequently the cause of the evil than the alleged Spanish flies, though the
latter are hurtful enough when present.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the kidneys may further be a form or an extension of a
specific contagious disease, such as erysipelas, rinderpest, septicemia, or
even of poisoning by the spores of fungi. Rivolta reports the case of a cow
with spots of local congestion and blood staining in the kidney, the affected
parts being loaded with bacteria. Unfortunately he neither cultivated the
bacteria nor inoculated them, and thus the case stands without positive
demonstration that they were the cause of disease.</p>

<p>In certain cases the <em>Symptoms</em> of nephritis are very manifest, and in others
so hidden that the existence of the affection can be certainly recognized only
by a microscopic examination of the urine. In violent cases there is high
fever, increase of the body temperature to 103Â° F. and upward; hurried
breathing, with a catching inspiration; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>accelerated pulse; dry, hot muzzle;
burning of the roots of the horns and ears; loss of appetite; suspended
rumination; and indications of extreme sensitiveness in the loins. The patient
stands with back arched and hind legs extended backward and outward, and passes
water frequently, in driblets, of a high color and specific gravity, containing
albumin and microscopic casts. (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 5.) When
made to move, the patient does so with hesitation and groaning, especially if
turned in a narrow circle; when pinched on the flank just beneath the lateral
bony processes of the loins, especially on that side on which the disease
predominates, it flinches and groans. If the examination is made with oiled
hand introduced through the last gut (rectum), the pressure upward on the
kidneys gives rise to great pain and to efforts to escape by moving away and by
active contractions of the rectum for the expulsion of the hand. Sometimes
there is a distinct swelling over the loins or quarter on one or both sides. In
uncastrated males the testicle on the affected side is drawn up, or is
alternately raised and dropped. In all there is a liability to tremors of the
thigh on the side affected.</p>

<p>In some severe cases colicky pains are as violent as in the worst forms of
indigestion and spasms of the bowels. The animal frequently shifts from one
hind foot to the other, stamps, kicks at the belly, frequently looks anxiously
at its flank, moans plaintively, lies down and quickly gets up again, grinds
its teeth, twists its tail, and keeps the back habitually arched and rigid and
the hind feet advanced under the belly. The bowels may be costive and the feces
glistening with a coat of mucus, or they may be loose and irritable, and the
paunch or even the bowels may become distended with gas (bloating) as the
result of indigestion and fermentation. In some animals, male and female alike,
the rigid, arched condition of the back will give way to such undulating
movements as are sometimes seen in the act of coition.</p>

<p>The disease does not always appear in its full severity; for a day, or even
two, however, there may be merely loss of appetite, impaired rumination, a
disposition to remain lying down, yet when the patient is raised it manifests
suffering by anxiously looking at the flanks, shifting or stamping of the hind
feet, shaking of the tail, and attempts to urinate, which are either fruitless
or lead to the discharge of a small quantity of high-colored or perhaps bloody
urine.</p>

<p>In some recent slight cases, and in many chronic ones, these symptoms may be
absent or unobserved, and an examination of the urine is necessary to reach a
safe conclusion. The urine may contain blood, or it may be cloudy from
contained albumin, which coagulates on heating with nitric acid (see
"Albuminuria," <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>); it may be slightly glairy
from pus, or gritty particles may be detected in it. In seeking for casts of
the uriniferous tubes, a drop may be taken with <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>a fine tube from the
bottom of the liquid after standing, and examined under a power magnifying
50 diameters. If the fine, cylindroid filaments are seen they may then be
examined with a power of 200 or 250 diameters. (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>,
fig. 5.) The appearance of the casts gives some clue to the condition of the
kidneys. If made up of large, rounded or slightly columnar cells, with a
single nucleus in each cell (epithelial), they imply comparatively slight and
recent disease of the kidney tubes, the detachment of the epithelium being
like what is seen in any inflamed mucous surface. If made up largely of the
small, disk-shaped and nonnucleated red blood globules, they imply escape of
blood, and usually a recent injury or congestion of the kidney&mdash;it may
be from sprains, blows, or the ingestion of acrid or diuretic poisons. If
the casts are made of a clear, waxy, homogeneous substance (hyaline), without
any admixture of opaque particles, they imply an inflammation of longer
standing, in which the inflamed kidney tubules have been already stripped
of their cellular (epithelial) lining. If the casts are rendered opaque by
the presence of minute, spherical granular cells, like white blood globules,
it betokens active suppuration of the kidney tubes. In other cases the casts
are rendered opaque by entangled earthy granules (carbonate of lime), or
crystals of some other urinary salts. In still other cases the casts entangle
clear, refrangent globules of oil or fat, which may imply fatty degeneration
of the kidneys or injury to the spinal cord. The presence of free pus giving
a glairy, flocculent appearance to the urine is suggestive of inflammation of
the urinary pouch at the commencement of the excretory duct (pelvis of kidney)
(<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig. 1), especially if complicated with
gritty particles of earthy salts. This condition is known as pyelitis. In the
chronic cases swelling of the legs or along the lower surface of chest or
abdomen, or within these respective cavities, is a common symptom. So, also,
stupor or coma, or even convulsions, may supervene from the poisonous action
of urea and other waste or morbid products retained in the blood.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In the treatment of acute nephritis the first consideration
is the removal of the cause. Acrid or diuretic plants in the feed must be
removed, and what of this kind is present in the stomach or bowels may be
cleared away by a moderate dose of castor or olive oil; extensive surfaces of
inflammation that have been blistered by Spanish flies must be washed clean
with soapsuds; sprains of the back or loins must be treated by soothing
fomentations or poultices or by a fresh sheepskin with its fleshy side applied
on the loins, and the patient must be kept in a narrow stall in which it can
not turn even its head. The patient must be kept in a warm, dry building, so
that the skin may be kept active rather than the kidneys. Warm blanketing is
equally important, or even mustard poultices over the loins will be useful.
Blisters of Spanish flies, turpentine, or other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127"
id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>agent which may be absorbed and irritate
the kidneys must be avoided. The active fever may be checked by 15 drops
tincture of aconite every four hours or by one-third ounce of acetanilid.
If pain is very acute, 1 ounce of laudanum or 2 drams of solid extract of
belladonna will serve to relieve. When the severity of the disease has passed,
a course of tonics (quinin, 2 drams, or gentian powder, 4 drams, daily) may be
given. Diuretics, too, may be given cautiously at this advanced stage to
relieve dropsy and give tone to the kidneys and general system (oil of
turpentine, 2 teaspoonfuls; bicarbonate of soda, 1 teaspoonful, repeated twice
a day). Pure water is essential, and it should not be given chilled; warm
drinks are preferable.</p>

<p>In the chronic forms of kidney inflammation the same protection against cold
and similar general treatment are demanded. Tonics, however, are important to
improve the general health (phosphate of iron, 2 drams; powdered nux vomica, 20
grains; powdered gentian root, 4 drams, daily). In some instances the mineral
acids (nitric acid, 60 drops, or nitrohydrochloric acid, 60 drops, daily) may
be used with the bitters. Mustard applied to the loins in the form of a thin
pulp made with water and covered for an hour with paper or other impervious
envelope, or water hotter than the hand can bear, or cupping, may be resorted
to as a counterirritant. In cupping, shave the loins, smear them with lard,
then take a narrow-mouthed glass, expand the air within by smearing its
interior with a few drops of alcohol, setting it on fire and instantly pressing
the mouth of the vessel to the oiled portion of the skin. As the air within the
vessel cools it contracts, tending to form a partial vacuum, and the skin,
charged with blood, is strongly drawn up within it. Several of these being
applied at once, a strong derivation from the affected kidneys is
obtained. In no case of inflamed or irritable kidney should Spanish flies or
oil of turpentine be used upon the skin.</p>

<h4>PARASITES OF THE KIDNEY.</h4>

<p>As the kidney is the visual channel by which the bacteria leave the system,
this organ is liable to be implicated when microphytes exist in the blood, and
congestions and blood extravasions are produced. In anthrax, southern cattle
fever (Texas fever), and other such affections bloody urine is the consequence.
Of the larger parasites attacking the kidney may be specially named the cystic
form of the echinococcus tapeworm of the dog, the cystic form of the unarmed or
beef tapeworm of man, the diving bladderworm&mdash;the cystic form of the
marginate tapeworm of the dog, and the giant strongyle&mdash; the largest of
the roundworms. These give rise to general symptoms of kidney disease, but the
true source of the trouble is likely to be detected only if the heads or
hooklets of the tapeworm or the eggs of the roundworm are found on
microscopical examination of the urine.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>TUMORS OF THE KIDNEY (HYPERTROPHY OR ATROPHY).</h4>

<p>The kidney may be the seat of cancerous or simple tumors, and it may be
unnaturally enlarged or reduced in size, but though there may be signs of
urinary disorder the true nature of the disease is seldom manifest until after
death. The passing of blood and of large multi-nucleated cells in the urine (to
be detected under the microscope) may betray the existence of an ulcerated
cancer of the kidney. The presence of cancerous enlargement of (superficial)
lymphatic glands may further assist and confirm the decision.</p>

<h4>RETENTION OF URINE.</h4>

<p>Inability to pass urine may come from any one of three
conditions&mdash;first, spasm of the neck of the bladder; second, paralysis of
the body of the bladder; third, obstruction of the channel of outlet by a stone
(calculus) (see <a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>) or other obstacle.</p>

<p>In <em>spasm of the neck of the bladder</em> the male animal may stand with the tail
slightly raised and making rhythmical contractions of the muscle beneath the
anus (accelerator urinÃ¦) (see <a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig. 2), but
without passing a drop of liquid. In the female the hind legs are extended,
widely parted, and the back is arched as if to urinate, but the effort is vain.
If the oiled hand is introduced into the rectum or vagina in the early stages
of the affection, the bladder may be felt beneath partially filled, but not
overdistended with liquid, and its neck or mouth firm and rigid. In the more
advanced stages of the affection the organ is felt as a great, tense,
elastic bag, extending forward into the abdomen. In this condition the
overdistended muscular coat of the bladder has lost its power of contraction,
so that true paralysis has set in, the muscle closing the mouth of the sac
alone retaining its contractile power.</p>

<p>In <em>paralysis of the body of the bladder</em> attention is rarely drawn to the
urinary disorder until the bladder has been distended to full repletion and is
almost ready to give way by rupture and to allow the escape of the contained
liquid into the abdomen. Overdistention is the most common cause of the
paralysis, yet it may occur from inflammation of the muscular wall of the
bladder, or even from injury to the terminal part of the spinal marrow. In this
last condition, however, the tail is liable to be powerless, and the neck of
the bladder may also be paralyzed, so that the urine dribbles away
continuously.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Among the causes of spasm of the neck of the bladder may be
named the lodgment of small stones or gravel, the feeding on irritant diuretics
(see "Bloody urine," <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>, or "Nephritis,"
<a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>), the enforced retention of
urine while at work or during a painful or difficult parturition. The
irritation attendant on inflammation of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129"
id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>mucous membrane of the bladder may
be a further cause of spasms of the neck, as may also be inflammation of the
channel (urethra) back of the neck. Extensive applications of Spanish flies to
the skin, the abuse of diuretics, and the occurrence of indigestion and spasms
of the bowels are further causes. So long as spasmodic colic is unrelieved,
retention of water from spasm of the neck of the bladder usually persists.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment depends largely on the cause. In indigestion the
irritant contents of the bowels must be got rid of by laxatives and injections
of warm water; Spanish-fly blisters must be washed from the surface; a
prolonged and too active exertion must be intermitted. The spasm may be relaxed
by injecting one-half ounce of solid extract of belladonna in water into the
rectum or by a solution of tobacco. Chloroform or ether may be given by
inhalation, or chloral hydrate (1 ounce) may be given in water by the mouth.
Fomentations of warm water may be made over the loins and between the thighs,
and the oiled hand inserted into the rectum may press moderately on the
anterior part of the bladder, which can be felt as an elastic fluctuating bag
of an oval shape just beneath.</p>

<p>All other measures failing, the liquid must be drawn off through a tube
(catheter). This is, however, exceedingly difficult, alike in male and female,
and we can not expect an amateur to succeed in accomplishing it. In the cow the
opening into the bladder is found in the median line of the floor of the
generative entrance, about 4 inches in front of the external opening, but it is
flanked on either side by a blind pouch, into which the catheter will pass, in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, in the hands of any but the most skilled
operator. In the bull or steer the penis, when retracted into its sheath, is
bent upon itself like the letter S, just above the scrotum and testicles (see
<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig. 2), and unless this bend is effaced by
extending the organ forward out of its sheath it is quite impossible to pass a
catheter beyond this point. When, however, by the presentation of a female, the
animal can be tempted to protrude the penis, so that it can be seized and
extended, or when it can be manipulated forward out of the sheath, it becomes
possible to pass a catheter of small caliber (one-third inch or under) onward
into the bladder. Youatt advised laying open the sheath so as to reach and
extend the penis, and others have advocated opening the urethra in the space
between the thighs or just beneath the anus, but such formidable operations are
beyond the stock owner. The incision of the narrow urethra through the great
thickness of muscular and erectile bleeding tissue just beneath the anus is
especially an operation of extreme delicacy and difficulty. Drawing the liquid
through the tube of an aspirator is another possible resort for the
professional man. The delicate needle of the aspirator is inserted in such
cases through the floor of the vagina and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>upper wall of the bladder in the female, or
through the floor of the rectum (last gut) and roof of the bladder in the male,
or finally through the lower and back part of the abdominal wall, just in front
of the bones of the pelvis (pubic bones), thence through the lower and anterior
part of the bladder near its blind anterior end. After relief has been obtained
the administration of belladonna in 2-dram doses daily for several days will
tend to prevent a recurrence of the retention.</p>

<p>When the body of the bladder has become benumbed or paralyzed by
overdistention, we may seek to restore its tone by doses of one-half a dram of
powdered nux vomica repeated daily, and by mustard plaster applied over the
loins, on the back part of the belly inferiorly, or between the thighs. Small
doses (2 drams) of balsam of copaiba are sometimes useful in imparting tone to
the partly paralyzed organ.</p>

<h4>INCONTINENCE OF URINE (PALSY OF THE NECK OF THE BLADDER).</h4>

<p>This may occur from disease or injury to the posterior part of the spinal
cord or from broken back, and in these cases the tail, and perhaps the hind
limbs, are liable to be paralyzed. In this case the urine dribbles away
constantly, and the oiled hand in the vagina or rectum will feel the
half-filled and flaccid bladder beneath and may easily empty it by pressure.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is only successful when the cause of the trouble
can be remedied. After these (sprains of the back, etc.) have recovered,
blisters (mustard) on the loins, the lower part of the abdomen, or between the
thighs may be resorted to with success. Two drams of copaiba or of solid
extract of belladonna or 2 grains Spanish flies daily may serve to restore the
lost tone. These failing, the use of electric currents may still prove
successful.</p>

<h4>URINARY CALCULI (STONE OR GRAVEL).</h4>

<p>Stone or gravel consists of hard bodies mainly made up of the solid earthy
constituents of the urine which have crystallized out of that liquid at some
part of the urinary passage, and have remained as small particles (gravel), or
have concreted into large masses (stone, calculus). (See <a
href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>, figs. 1, 2, 3.) In cattle it is no uncommon thing
to find them distending the practically microscopic tubes in the red substance
of the kidney, having been deposited from the urine in the solid form almost as
soon as that liquid has been separated from the blood. These stones appear as
white objects on the red ground formed by cutting sections of the kidney, and
are essentially products of the dry feed of winter, and are most <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131"
id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>common in working oxen, which are called upon
to exhale more water from the lungs and skin than are the slop-fed and inactive
cows. Little water being introduced into the body with the feed and considerable
being expelled with the breath and perspiration in connection with the active
life, the urine becomes small in amount, but having to carry out all waste
material from the tissues and the tissue-forming feed it becomes so charged
with solids that it is ready to deposit them on the slightest disturbance.
If, therefore, a little of the water of such concentrated urine is reabsorbed
at any point of the urinary passages the remainder is no longer able to hold
the solids in solution, and they are at once precipitated in the solid form
as gravel or commencing stone. In cattle, on the other hand, which are kept
at pasture in summer, or which are fed liberally on roots, potatoes, pumpkins,
apples, or ensilage in winter, this concentrated condition of the urine is
not induced, and under such circumstances, therefore, the formation of stone
is practically unknown. Nothing more need be said to show the controlling
influence of dry feeding in producing gravel and of a watery ration in preventing
it. Calculus in cattle is essentially a disease of winter and of such cattle
as are denied succulent feed and are confined to dry fodder as their exclusive
ration. While there are exceptions, they are so rare that they do not invalidate
this general rule. It is true that stone in the kidney or bladder is often found
in the summer or in animals feeding at the time on a more or less succulent
ration, yet such masses usually date back to a former period when the animals
were restricted to a dry ration.</p>

<p>In this connection is should be noted that a great drain of water from the
system by any other channel than the kidneys predisposes to the production of
gravel or stone. In case of profuse diarrhea, for example, or of excessive
secretion of milk, there is a corresponding diminution of the water of the
blood, and as the whole quantity of the blood is thus decreased and as the
urine secreted is largely influenced by the fullness of the blood vessels and
the pressure exerted upon their walls from within, it follows that with this
decrease of the mass of the blood and the lessening of its pressure outward
there will be a corresponding decrease of urine. The waste of the tissues,
however, goes on as before, and if the waste matter is passed out through the
kidneys it must be in a more concentrated solution, and the more concentrated
the urine the greater the danger that the solids will be deposited as small
crystals or calculi.</p>

<p>Again, the concentrated condition of the urine which predisposes to such
deposits is favored by the quantity of lime salts that may be present in the
water drunk by the animal. Water that contains 20 or 30 grains of carbonate or
sulphate of lime to the gallon must con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tribute a large addition of solids to
the blood and urine as compared with soft waters from which lime is absent. In
this connection it is a remarkable fact that stone and gravel in the
domesticated herbivora are notoriously prevalent on many limestone soils, as on
the limestone formations of central and western New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
and Michigan; on the calcareous formations of Norfolk, Suffolk, Derbyshire,
Shropshire, and Gloucestershire, in England; in Landes in France, and around
Munich in Bavaria. It does not follow that the abundance of lime in the water
and fodder is the main cause of the calculi, as other poisons which are
operative in the same districts in causing goiter in both man and animal
probably contribute to the trouble, yet the excess of earthy salts in the
drinking water can hardly fail to add to the saturation of both blood and
urine, and thereby to favor the precipitation of the urinary solids from their
state of solution.</p>

<p>The known results of feeding cattle a generous or forcing ration in which
phosphate of lime is present to excess adds additional force to the view just
advanced. In the writer's experience, the Second Duke of Oneida, a magnificent
product of his world-famed family, died as the result of a too liberal
allowance of wheat bran, fed with the view of still further improving the bone
and general form of the Duchess strain of Shorthorns. Lithotomy was performed
and a number of stones removed from the bladder and urethra, but the patient
succumbed to an inflammation of the bowels, induced by the violent purgatives
given before the writer arrived, under the mistaken idea that the straining had
been caused by intestinal impaction. In this case not only the Second Duke of
Oneida, but the other males of the herd as well, had the tufts of hairs at the
outlet of the sheath encased in hard, cylindroid sheaths of urinary salts,
precipitated from the liquid as it ran over them. The tufts were in reality
resolved into a series of hard, rollerlike bodies, more or less constricted at
intervals, as if beaded.</p>

<p>When it is stated that the ash of the whole grain of wheat is but 3 per
cent, while the ash of wheat bran is 7.3 per cent, and that in the case of the
former 46.38 per cent of the ash is phosphoric acid, and in that of the latter
50 per cent, it can easily be understood how a too liberal use of wheat bran
should prove dangerous if fed dry. The following table shows the relative
proportion of ash and phosphoric acid in wheat bran and in some common farm
seeds:</p>

<p>Wheat bran, it will be observed, contains three times as much phosphoric
acid as is found in any of the other grains, and four times as much as oats,
beans, peas, or rye; so that if fed in excess it will readily overcharge the
urine with phosphates.</p>

<p>There is another point to be considered, however, in estimating this danger.
Wheat bran contains a far greater quantity of albuminoids and other
nitrogen-containing constituents than the common grains (these being made up
mainly of starch, which contains no nitrogen); and, all nitrogen-bearing
products contained in the blood and tissues being expelled from the body mainly
through the kidneys in the form of urea and (in cattle) hippuric acid, it
follows that the excess of urea formed when such feed is consumed must load the
urine with solids and bring it constantly nearer to the point of saturation,
when such solids (or the least soluble of them) must be deposited.</p>

<p>The following table will show the relative amounts of the nitrogen-bearing
products in wheat bran and some of our common grains:</p>

<p>It will be observed that, with the exception of oats, none of the grains
contain more than two-thirds of the nitrogenous material <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>present in the wheat
bran, while in the case of rye and maize there is practically but one-half.
Even in the case of oats the albuminoids, which are the more digestible
principles, and therefore those that are the most easily and speedily converted
into urea, are present only to the amount of two-thirds of that which exists in
the wheat bran. With such an excess of ash, of phosphates, and of nitrogenous
(urea-forming) constituents in wheat bran, its tendency to favor the formation
of calculi is fully explained. It must not, however, be inferred that wheat
bran is not a valuable feedstuff. The inference is only that it should be fed
with an abundance of water, as a sloppy mash, or in combination with an
abundance of roots, potatoes, pumpkins, or other succulent aliment.</p>

<p>In this connection the presence of magnesia in the feed or water must be
named as favoring calculous formations in the urinary passages. The explanation
is that while the phosphate of magnesia thrown out in the urine is soluble in
water, the compound phosphate of ammonia and magnesia is insoluble, and,
accordingly, if at any time ammonia is introduced into urine containing the
phosphate of magnesia there is instantly formed the ammonio-magnesium
phosphate, which is as promptly deposited in the solid form. The common source
of ammonia in such cases is from decomposition of the urea in fermenting urine.
In order to produce this a ferment is necessary, however, and therefore, as an
additional prerequisite, the presence of bacteria, or fungi, in the urine is
essential. These ferments may make their way from without along the urinary
passage (urethra), and their propagation in the bladder is greatly favored by
the prolonged retention of urine, as in case of spasm of the neck of the
bladder or obstruction by an already existing stone. Another mode of entrance
of the ferment is an unclean catheter used to draw the urine. Still another is
the elimination through the kidneys of the bacteria of infectious diseases, or
of such as, without producing a general infection, yet determine fermentation
in the urine. The precipitation is favored not only by the production of
ammonia, but also by the formation of viscid (colloid) products of
fermentation. In this sense bacteria are most important factors in causing
gritty deposits in the urine.</p>

<p>Another insoluble salt which enters largely into the composition of many
urinary calculi of the ox is carbonate of lime. This is derived mainly from the
lime in the feed and water and from the carbon dioxid formed by the oxidation
of the organic acids in the fodder. These organic acids, being composed of
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (without nitrogen), are resolved by the addition
of oxygen into carbon dioxid (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O). The
carbon dioxid unites with the lime in the blood to form carbonate of lime, and
in this state passes into the urine. Now, carbonate of lime is soluble in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>water
containing free or uncombined carbon dioxid, but is precipitated whenever the
latter is withdrawn. It is only necessary, therefore, to have in the urine
sufficient lime or other available base to unite with all the free carbon
dioxid in order to bring about the precipitation of the dissolved carbonate of
lime in the solid, crystallized form; hence it is that, of all
sediments in the urine of herbivora, this is the most frequent and usually the
most abundant.</p>

<p>A less common constituent of urinary calculi is the insoluble oxalate of
lime. In this case the lime is derived as before from the feed or water, or
both, while the oxalic acid is a product of the oxidation of organic acids of
the feed, less oxygen having been used than in the formation of carbon dioxid.
The final product of the complete oxidation of these acids is carbon dioxid,
but when less oxygen is furnished, owing to some disease of the lungs or a
disease of the nerve centers, which lessens the activity of the breathing, then
oxalic acid may be produced. If this oxalic acid comes into contact with lime,
it is instantly precipitated as crystals of oxalate of lime.</p>

<p>Another inorganic substance at times found in urinary calculi is silica
(SiO<sub>2</sub>). This contributes largely to giving stiffness to the stems of
growing plants, and in most of our cereals and grasses makes up a large
proportion of the ashes of the burned plant. It is found in the soluble form in
combination as silicate of potash, but at times is displaced by oxalic or other
acid and then appears as gritty, sandy particles in the stem. This gritty,
insoluble silica is especially noticeable among the horsetails (<em>EquisetacÃ¦ceÃ¦</em>),
bamboos, and sedges. The per cent of silica in the ash of several common fodder
plants is given below:</p>

<p>It is only soluble silica that is taken up into the system, and it is in
this form (usually as silicate of potash or soda) that it enters the urine, but
all that is wanted to precipitate it in crystalline form as a gritty sand is
the presence of oxalic or other acid having a stronger affinity for its base
(potash or soda).</p>

<p>Other conditions, however, enter largely into the causation of stone, or
gravel. A high density of urine resulting from a highly saturated condition is
often present for a length of time without <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>any precipitation of solid materials. Urea
and carbonates may be present in excess, the feed may be given dry, and
drinking water may be deficient in quantity without any deposition of
stone or gravel. In such cases, the presence of noncrystalline organic matter
in the urine becomes an exciting cause. Rainey and Ord have shown
experimentally that colloid (noncrystallizable) bodies like mucus, epithelial
cells, albumin, pus, blood, hyaline casts of the kidney tubes, etc., not only
determine the precipitation of crystallizable salts from a strong solution, but
they determine the precipitation in the form of globular masses, or minute
spheres, which, by further similar accessions, become stones, or calculi, of
various sizes. The salts that are deposited by mere chemical reaction without
the intervention of colloids appear in the form of sharply defined angular
crystals, and hence the rough, jagged crystals of oxalate of lime or
ammonia-magnesium phosphate. Heat intensifies the action of the colloids in
causing precipitation of the dissolved salts, so that the temperatures of the
kidneys and bladder constitute favorable conditions. Colloids that are
undergoing decomposition are also specially powerful, so that the presence of
bacteria or fungi causing fermentation is an important factor.</p>

<p>In looking, therefore, for the immediate causes of urinary calculi we must
accord a high place to all those conditions which determine the presence of
excess of mucus, albumin, pus, blood, kidney casts, blood-coloring matter,
etc., in the urine. A catarrhal inflammation of the pelvis of the kidney, of
the ureter, or of the bladder, generating excess of mucus or pus; inflammation
of the kidneys, causing the discharge of blood, albumin, or hyaline casts into
the urinary passages; inflammation of the liver, lungs, or other distant organ,
resulting in the escape of albumin in the urine; disorders of the liver or of
the blood-forming functions, resulting in hematuria or hemoglobinuria; sprains
or other injuries to the back, or disease of the spinal marrow, which cause the
escape of blood with the urine; the presence in the bladder of a bacterial
ferment, which determines the decomposition of the mucus and urea, the
evolution of ammonia and the consequent destruction of the protecting cellular
(epithelia) lining of the bladder, or the irritation caused by the presence of
an already formed calculus, may produce the colloid or uncrystallizable body
that proves so effective in the precipitation of stone or gravel. It has long
been known that calculi almost invariably form around any foreign body
introduced into the kidney or bladder, and I have seen a large, calculous mass
surrounding a splinter of an arrow that had penetrated and broken off in the
body of a deer. The explanation is now satisfactory&mdash;the foreign body
carries in with it bacteria, which act as ferments upon the urine <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>and mucus in
addition to the mechanical injury caused by its presence. If such a body has
been introduced through the solid tissues, there is, in addition, the presence
of the blood and lymph derived from the wounded structures.</p>

<h4>CLASSIFICATION OF URINARY CALCULI.</h4>

<p>Urinary calculi are most conveniently divided according to the locality in
which they are found. Thus we find first renal calculi, formed in the kidney (<a
href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 1), and which for cattle must be again
divided into calculi of the uriniferous tubes and calculi of the pelvis. The
second class are named ureteral calculi because they are found in the duct
leading from the kidney to the bladder (ureter). The third class are the
vesical calculi, from the bladder or vesicle in which they are found. The
fourth class are the urethral calculi, and are found in the duct leading
outward from the bladder through the penis (urethra). The fifth and last class
are the preputial calculi, since they are found within the sheath of the penis
(prepuce).</p>

<p>Calculi may also be classed according to their chemical composition and this
has the advantage of suggesting the special cause of each as found in the feed,
water, soil, or general conditions of health. This classification affords no
guide to their location or symptoms, as calculi of the same chemical
composition may be formed at any part of the urinary passages, as those formed
in the kidney may pass on through all the various passages outward, unless it
is found at any point of their progress that they have grown so large that the
passage will not admit them. The following are among the concretions found in
the various parts:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Coralline calculi</em>.&mdash;These are of a dull-white color and irregular
surface, like coral. They are made up of hard and resistant layers evenly
deposited around a central nucleus. (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 3.)
Their specific gravity is 1,760, water being 1,000, and they contain 74 per
cent of carbonate of lime with some carbonate of magnesia, organic matter, and
a trace of carbonate of iron. Yellowish-white, smooth, round calculi of the
same chemical composition are met with.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Pearly calculi</em>.&mdash;These are more frequent than the first-named
variety. They are very hard and smooth on the surface, reflecting a play of
various colors after the fashion of a pearl. This peculiarity appears to be
caused by the thinness and semitransparency of the supposed layers. They have a
specific gravity of 2,109 to 2,351, and nearly the same chemical composition as
the coralline variety. Golding Bird found a specimen of this kind formed of
carbonate of lime and organic matter only.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Green calculi</em> (<em>metalloid calculi</em>).&mdash;These are usually small and
numerous, as they are exceedingly common. They are of a very hard <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>consistency,
and have a clear-polished, greenish surface of almost metallic brilliancy. They
have a specific gravity of 2.301 and a composition almost identical with the
second variety.</p>

<p>(4) <em>White calculi</em>.&mdash;Pure white, smooth, lustrous calculi are rare. They
have a specific gravity of 2.307, and contain as much as 92 per cent of
carbonate of lime with carbonate of magnesia and organic matter.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Ammonio-magnesium calculi</em>.&mdash;These are of a grayish color and a very
rough, crystalline surface, which proves very irritating to the mucous
membrane. They have a specific gravity of 1.109 to 1.637, and are composed
chiefly of ammonio-magnesium phosphate, oxalate of lime, and organic matter,
with a little carbonate of lime and magnesia.</p>

<p>(6) <em>Siliceous calculi</em>.&mdash;These are clear, smooth, and hard, and usually
spherical. They have a specific gravity of 1.265 to 1.376, and contain 57 per
cent of silica with carbonates of iron and magnesia, organic matter, and traces
of iron. In other specimens of siliceous calculi there was a specific gravity
of 3.122, and there was 79 to 85 per cent of carbonate of lime together with
carbonate of magnesia, and iron, silica, and organic matter. Others are almost
exclusively made of silica.</p>

<p>(7) <em>Oxalate of lime calculi</em> (<em>mulberry calculi</em>)
(<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 2).&mdash; These are characterized by their
extremely rough, angular surface, formed by the octahedral crystals of oxalate of
lime. Their specific gravity may be 3.441, and they contain oxalate of lime to the
extent of 81 per cent, together with carbonates of lime and magnesia and organic
matter.</p>

<p>(8) <em>Gravel</em> (<em>pultaceous deposits</em>).&mdash;Simple crystals may be
met with at any point from the kidneys to the external opening at the end of the
prepuce (sheath), and they may appear singly, as crystals, or they may accumulate
in masses of fine spherical crystals almost like dirty powdered chalk suspended in
water. In the ox this is especially common as a collection in the sheath, distending
that into a soft, doughy swelling.</p>

<h4>FORMS OF CALCULI IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.</h4>

<p>Apart from the rough crystalline surfaces of the calculi of oxalate of lime
and ammonio-magnesium phosphate, the general tendency is to a smooth, round
outline. At times, however, they show more or less flattening with rounded
angular edges, caused by the contact and mutual friction of two calculi.
Sometimes two or more stones lying together become united into one by a new
external deposit, and the resulting mass then shows rounded swellings on
opposite sides. The large calculi occupying the pelvis of the kidneys usually
show a central part having the outline of the main cavity of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>pelvis and
two or more projections that have been molded into the corresponding branches
or channels which lead to corresponding lobes of the kidney. In winter and
spring small concretions in the form of plates are often met with in the
branches of the pelvis, having been formed and molded in the confined space
between the projecting papilla and the surrounding cuplike branch of the
pelvis. Finally, the pulplike deposits in the sheath and elsewhere are made up
of globular masses, individually so small as to be often practically
microscopic.</p>

<h4>STONE IN THE KIDNEY (RENAL CALCULI).</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 1.]</h5>

<p>In an animal leading the quiet, uneventful life of the ox, stones of large
size may be present in the kidney without producing any disorder appreciable to
the people about him. In cattle fattened on dry feed in winter, on the
magnesian limestone of New York, it is exceptional to find the substance of the
kidney free from calculi about the size of a grain of wheat or less, and
standing out as white objects in the general red of the cut surface of the
organ. Similarly around the papillÃ¦ in the cuplike arms of the pelvis we find
minute, flattened or more or less rounded, yellowish-white concretions. Even
the large concretions may prove apparently harmless. I have a calculus several
ounces in weight which filled the entire pelvis of the kidney, that was found
by accident in a fat carcass while being dressed. In work oxen, however, such
concretions may give rise to symptoms of kidney disease, such as stiffness of
the loins, shown especially in the acts of rising or turning, weakness of the
hind parts when set to pull a heavy load, an irritability of the kidneys, shown
by the frequent passage of urine in small quantity, tenderness of the loins,
shown when they are pinched or lightly struck, and it may be the passage of
blood or minute gritty masses with the urine. If the attack is severe, what is
called "renal colic" (kidney colic) may be shown by frequent uneasy shifting of
the hind limbs, shaking or twisting of the tail, looking around at the flanks,
and lying down and rising again at short intervals without apparent cause. The
frequent passage of urine, the blood or gritty masses contained in it, and
perhaps the hard, stony cylinders around the tufts of hair of the sheath, show
that the source of the suffering is the urinary organs. In bad cases active
inflammation of the kidneys may set in. (See "Nephritis," <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>.)</p>

<h4>URETERAL CALCULI.</h4>

<p>These are small stones which have passed from the pelvis of the kidney into
the canal (ureter) leading from the kidney to the bladder, but, being too large
to pass on easily, have blocked that canal and <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>forced the urine back upon the
kidney. The result is the production of symptoms more violent than in renal
calculi, though not varying, save in intensity, from those of renal colic. In
case of complete and unrelieved obstruction, the secretion of the kidney on
that side is entirely abolished, and it becomes the seat of passive congestion,
and it may even be absorbed in greater part or as a whole, leaving only a
fibrous sac containing fluid with a urinous odor. In small cattle, in which the
oiled hand introduced into the last gut may reach the affected part, the
distended ureter may be felt as a tense, elastic cord, extending forward from
the point of obstruction on the lateral wall of the pelvis and beneath the
loins toward the kidney. If relief is obtained by the onward passage of the
stone a free flow of urine usually follows, in the midst of which may often be
found gritty masses. If the outlets from both kidneys are similarly blocked the
animal becomes poisoned by the retention in the blood of the elements of the
urine, and by their reabsorption after secretion.</p>

<p><em>Treatment of renal and ureteral calculi</em>.&mdash;Treatment is not very
successful, as only the smallest calculi can pass through the ureter and enter
the bladder, and even if they should do so they are liable to a progressive
increase there, so that later they may cause the symptoms of stone in the
bladder. Fortunately, ordinary dairy, growing, or fattening cattle rarely show
evident symptoms of illness, and even though they do so they can usually be
fattened and slaughtered before the health is seriously impaired. In work oxen
the case is different, and acute symptoms may develop, but even then the animal
may often be fitted for the butcher. When treatment is demanded it is primarily
soothing and antispasmodic. Fomentations with warm water over the loins should
be persisted in without intermission until relief has been secured. The
soothing effect on the kidney will often relieve inflammation and irritation,
should the stone be in that situation, while if in the ureter the warm
fomentations will at once soothe irritation, relax spasm of the muscular coat
of the canal, and favor an abundant secretion from the kidney, which, pressing
on the obstructing stone, may slowly push it on into the bladder. Large doses
of laudanum (2 ounces) or of solid extract of belladonna (2 drams) will not
only soothe the pain but relax the spasm and favor the onward passage of the
calculus. The animal should be encouraged to drink large quantities of cool
water to favor the free secretion of a very watery urine, which will not only
serve to obviate irritation and continued deposit caused by a highly
concentrated urine, but will press the stone onward toward the bladder, and
even in certain cases will tend to disintegrate it by solution of some of its
elements, and thus to favor its crumbling and expulsion. This is a principle
which must never be lost sight of in the treatment of calculi. The immersion of
the stone in a liquid of a lower specific gravity than that in which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>has
formed and grown tends to dissolve out the more soluble of its component parts,
and thus to destroy its density and cohesion at all points, and thereby to
favor its complete disintegration and expulsion. This explains why cattle taken
from a herd on magnesian limestone in spring, after the long, dry feeding of
winter, usually have renal calculi, while cattle from the same herd in the
fall, after a summer's run on a succulent pasture, are almost always free from
concretions. The abundance of liquid taken in the green feed and expelled
through the kidneys and the low density or watery nature of the urine have so
opened the texture and destroyed the density of the smaller stones and gravel
that they have all been disintegrated and removed. This, too, is the main
reason why benefit is derived from a prolonged stay at mineral springs by the
human victims of gravel. If they had swallowed the same number of quarts of
pure water at home and distributed it at suitable times each day, they would
have benefited largely without a visit to the springs.</p>

<p>It follows from what has been just said that a succulent diet, including a
large quantity of water (gruels, sloppy mashes, turnips, beets, potatoes,
apples, pumpkins, ensilage, succulent grasses), is an important factor in the
relief of the milder forms of stone and gravel.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Prevention of calculus especially demands this supply of
water and watery rations on all soils and in all conditions in which there is a
predisposition to the disease. It must also be sought by attempts to obviate
all those conditions mentioned above as causative of the malady. Sometimes good
rain water can be furnished in limestone districts, but putrid or bad-smelling
rain water is to be avoided as probably more injurious than that from the
limestone. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to dissolve calculi by alkaline
salts and mineral acids, respectively, but their failure as a remedy does not
necessarily condemn them as preventives. One dram of caustic potash or of
hydrochloric acid may be given daily in the drinking water. In diametrically
opposite ways these attack and decompose the less soluble salts and form new
ones which are more soluble and therefore little disposed to precipitate in the
solid form. Both are beneficial as increasing the secretion of urine. In cases
in which the diet has been too highly charged with phosphates (wheat bran,
etc.), these aliments must be restricted and water allowed ad libitum. If the
crystals passed with the urine are the sharp angular (octahedral) ones of
oxalate of lime, then the breathing should be made more active by exercise, and
any disease of the lungs subjected to appropriate treatment. If the crystals
are triangular prisms of ammonia-magnesium phosphate or starlike forms with
feathery rays, the indications are to withhold the feed or water that abounds
in magnesia and check the fermentation in the urine by attempts to destroy its
bacteria. In the latter direction plenty of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>pure-water diuretics, and a daily dose of oil
of turpentine in milk, or a dose thrice a day of a solution containing one-tenth
grain each of biniodid of mercury and iodid of potassium would be indicated.</p>

<p>In considering the subject of prevention, it must never be forgotten that
any disease of a distant organ which determines the passage from the blood into
the urine of albumin or any other colloid (uncrystallizable) body is strongly
provocative of calculus, and should, if possible, be corrected. Apart from
cases from geological formation, faulty feeding, and other causes, the grand
preventive of calculus is a long, summer's pasturage of succulent grasses, or
in winter a diet of ensilage or other succulent feed.</p>

<p>The calculi formed in part of silica demand special notice. This agent is
secreted in the urine in the form of silicate of potash and is thrown down as
insoluble silica when a stronger acid displaces it by combining with the potash
to its exclusion. In cases of siliceous calculi, accordingly, the appropriate
chemical prevention is caustic potash, which being present in the free state
would attract to itself any free acid and leave the silica in its soluble
condition as silicate of potash.</p>

<h4>STONE IN THE BLADDER (VESICAL CALCULUS, OR URETHRAL CALCULUS).</h4>

<p>Stone in the bladder may be of any size, but in the ox does not usually
exceed half an inch in diameter. There may, however, be a number of small
calculi; indeed, they are sometimes so small and numerous as to form a
small, pulpy magma by which the bladder is considerably distended.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of stone in the bladder may be absent until one
of the masses escapes into the urethra, but when this occurs the escape of
urine is prevented, or it is allowed to pass in drops or driblets only, and the
effect of such obstruction becomes manifest. The point of obstruction is not
always the same, but it is most frequently at the S-shaped curve of the penis,
just above the testicles or scrotum. In cows and heifers the urethra is so
short and becomes so widely dilated during the urination that the calculi
easily escape in the flow of liquid and dangerous symptoms practically never
appear.</p>

<p>Even in the male the signs of illness are at first very slight. A close
observer may notice the cylinders of hard, earthy materials encircling the
tufts of hair at the opening of the prepuce. It may further be observed that
the stall remains dry and that the animal has not been seen to pass water when
out of doors. The tail may at times be gently raised and contractions of the
muscle (accelerator urinÃ¦) beneath the anus (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig.
2) may take place in a rhythmical or pulsating manner. As a rule, however,
no symptom is noticed for two days, only the animal is lacking in his usual
spirits. By this time the constantly accumulating urine has distended the
blad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>der
beyond its power of resistance and a rupture occurs, allowing the urine
to escape into the cavity of the abdomen. Then dullness increases; the animal
lies down most of his time; he becomes stupid and sometimes drowsy, with
reddish-brown congestion of the lining membrane of the eyelids; pressure on the
abdomen causes pain, flinching, and perhaps groaning, and the lowest part of
the belly fluctuates more and more as the escaping urine accumulates in greater
and greater amount. If at this stage the oiled hand is introduced into the
rectum (last gut), the animal flinches when pressure is made downward on the
floor of the pelvis, and no round, distended bladder is felt. If the same
examination is made prior to the rupture, the rounded, tense, elastic bladder
is felt extending forward into the abdomen, containing one or two gallons of
liquid. There may be uneasy shifting of the hind limbs and twisting of the
tail, also frequent lying down and rising, but these symptoms are
exceptional.</p>

<p>When the obstruction is low down between the thighs (at the S-shaped
flexure), the line of the pulsating urethra from the anus downward may be felt
distended with liquid, and though, by the hard swelling of the urethra, it is
seldom easy to distinguish the exact seat of the stone, yet there is usually
tenderness at the point of obstruction, and from this it may be accurately
located.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment of stone in the bladder or urethra consists
in the removal of the stone by incision and the use of forceps. (Pl. XI, fig.
4.) When the stone has been arrested at the S-shaped flexure just above the
scrotum, the patient being lean, the thickened tender part of the penis may be
seized between the fingers and thumb of the left hand, while the calculus is
exposed by a free incision with the knife held in the right. If there is no
other obstruction between this point and the bladder, and if the latter has not
yet ruptured, a flow of urine should take place from the opening. If there is
no escape of liquid, a catheter or sound, one-fourth of an inch in diameter,
must be passed up through the canal (urethra) until it is arrested by the next
stone, on which a similar incision should then be made to effect its
extraction. In case the stone has been arrested in the portion of the urethra
which is in front of the arch of the hip bone and inside the pelvis, it can be
reached only by making an opening into the urethra beneath the anus and over
the arch of the hip bone, and from this orifice exploring the urethra with fine
forceps to the neck of the bladder or until the stone has been reached and
extracted. Owing to the small size of the canal (urethra) to be opened and the
great thickness of erectile tissue to be cut through, the operation requires a
very accurate knowledge of the parts, while the free flow of blood is blinding
to the operator. A staff should always be passed up through the urethra from
the lower wound, if such has been made, or, in case of its absence, through the
whole length of the penis, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144"
id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>organ having been drawn out of its sheath until
the S-shaped curve has been effaced and the course of the canal rendered
straight. Upon the end of this staff the incision can be made with far more
confidence and certainty. The operation can be undertaken only by a skilled
veterinary anatomist, but the hints given above may be valuable in showing the
stock owner when he is being properly served in such a case.</p>

<p>In outlying districts, where no skilled operator can be had, a transverse
incision may be made with a clean, sharp knife through the root of the penis,
just over the arch of the hip bone, when the urine will flow out in a full
stream. The attendant bleeding may be ignored, or if profuse it may be checked
by packing the wound firmly with cotton wool for several hours. The urine will
continue to escape by the wound, and the ox should be fattened for the
butcher.</p>

<p>The immediate relief is not to be looked upon as a permanent cure, as the
calculi in the affected ox are usually numerous, and later attacks are
therefore to be looked for. Hence it is desirable to fatten and kill such cases
after a successful operation. If a breeding animal is too valuable to be
killed, he should be subjected to preventive measures, as laid down under
"Stone in the kidney," <a href="#Page_139">page 139</a>.</p>

<p>It should be added that when the bladder is filled with a soft magma a
catheter may be introduced through the whole length of the urethra to be used
in pumping water into the bladder. This water is extracted through the same
channel when it has been charged with the suspended solids by manipulations of
the bladder with the oiled hand introduced through the rectum.</p>

<h4>CALCULI, OR GRAVEL, IN THE PREPUCE, OR SHEATH.</h4>

<p>This is usually a collection of gravel, or a soft, puttylike material which
causes distinct swelling of the sheath and gives it a soft, doughy feeling when
handled. It may be removed in part by the oiled fingers introduced into the
cavity, assisted by manipulation from without, or a tube may be inserted until
the end extends behind the collection and water pumped in until the whole mass
has been evacuated. Should even this fail of success, the sheath may be slit
open from its orifice back in the median line below until the offending matter
can be reached and removed. In all such cases the interior of the sheath should
be finally lubricated with sweet oil or vaseline. It is unnecessary to stitch
up the wound made in the sheath. (See "Inflammation of the sheath,"
<a href="#Page_155">p. 155</a>.)</p>

Microscopic anatomy of the kidney.</p>

<p class="dop2">Fig. 1. In this figure the minute apparatus for the secretion, collection,
and discharge of the urine into the pelvis of the kidney (see preceding plate)
is shown. The course is as follows: The urine is secreted from the blood
vessels in the little round bodies called glomeruli (12), and by the minute
cells in the curved tubes (11, 9, 10, 8), and passes through the convoluted and
straight tubes (7, 6) into the larger tube (1), and then out into the pelvis,
thence through the ureters into the bladder. The fluid and salts dissolved in
the urine are taken from the blood, and the minute blood vessels are therefore
very abundant in the kidneys, as is shown by the branches and network on the
left of the figure. The blood passes into the kidney in the artery (13), which
then divides into branches which pass into the glomeruli (12) and also forms
network around the secreting tubules (11, 9). The urine and salts pass from
these vessels through the cells lining the tubules into the latter, and are
discharged as described above. The blood is again collected in veins drawn
black in the figure.</p>

<h4>GENERAL DISCUSSION.</h4>

<p>Diseases of the generative organs are practically confined to animals which
are kept for reproduction and the dairy. The castration of the bull condemns
these organs to inactivity and protects them from the many causes of injury
attendant on the engorged blood vessels in the frequent periods of sexual
excitement, on the exposure to mechanical violence, and on the exposure to
infective inoculation. In three respects the castrated male is especially
subject to disease: (1) To inflammation and tumefaction of the cut end of the
cord that supported the testicle and of the loose connective tissue of the
scrotum; (2) to inflammation of the sheath and penis from the accumulation of
gravel in the former, from which the penis is not usually protruded in passing
water; and (3) to bruising, abrasion, and inflammation of the sheath and penis
during suspension in the stocks for the purpose of shoeing. Apart from these
the ox is practically almost exempt from the inflammations and injuries of the
genital organs. The same applies to the castrated heifer. Inflammation may
occur in the broad ligament of the womb whence the ovary has been removed or
infective inflammation in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) in case the
operation has been performed through the flank, as it usually is in the young
heifer. Apart from these, the castrated heifer is practically immune
from any trouble of the generative apparatus. Even the virgin heifer is little
subject to such troubles, though she is not exempt from inflammations, and
above all, from morbid growths in the ovaries which are well developed and
functionally very active after the first year, or in precocious animals after
the first few months of life. The breeding cow, on the other hand, is subjected
to all the disturbances attendant on the gradual enlargement of the womb, the
diversion of a large mass of blood to its walls, the constant drain of nutrient
materials of all kinds for the nourishment of the fetus, the risks attendant
and consequent on abortion and parturition, the dangers of infection from the
bull, the risks of sympathetic disturbance in case of serious diseases of other
organs, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
but preeminently of the urinary organs and the udder, and finally the
sudden extreme derangements of the circulation and of the nervous functions
which attend on the sudden revulsion of a great mass of blood from the walls of
the contracting womb into the body at large immediately after calving.</p>

<p>In reviewing this class of diseases, therefore, we have to note, first, that
they are almost exclusively restricted to breeding animals, and secondly that
in keeping with the absolute difference of the organs in the male and female we
find two essentially distinct lists of diseases affecting the two sexes.</p>

<h4>EXCESS OF VENEREAL DESIRE (SATYRIASIS IN MALE, OR NYMPHOMANIA IN
FEMALE).</h4>

<p>This may occur in the male from too frequent sexual intercourse, or from
injury and congestion of the base of the brain (vasodilator center in the
medulla), or of the posterior end of the spinal cord, or it may be kept up by
congestion or inflammation of the testicles or of the mucous membrane covering
the penis. It may be manifested by a constant or frequent erection, by attempts
at sexual connection, and sometimes by the discharge of semen without
connection. In bad cases the feverishness and restlessness lead to loss of
flesh, emaciation, and physical weakness.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the female especially that this morbid desire is most
noticeable and injurious. It may be excited by the stimulating quality of the
blood in cows fed to excess on highly nitrogenous feed, as the seeds of the
bean, pea, vetch, and tare, and as wheat bran, middlings, cotton seed, gluten
meal, etc., especially in the case of such as have no free exercise in the
fields, and are subject to constant association with a vigorous young bull. A
more frequent cause is the excitation or congestion of some part of the genital
organs. Disease of the ovaries is preeminently the cause, and this may be by
the formation of cysts (sacs containing liquid) or of solid tumors or
degenerations, or, more commonly than all, the formation of tubercle. Indeed,
in case of tuberculosis attacking the abdominal organs of cows, the ovaries or
the serous membranes that support and cover them (the broad ligaments of the
womb) are peculiarly subject to attack, and the animal has constant
sexual excitement, incessantly riding or being ridden by other cattle, having
no leisure to eat or chew the cud, but moving restlessly, wearing the flesh off
its bones, and gradually wasting. In some localities these cows are known as
"bullers," because they are nearly always disposed to take the bull, but they
do not conceive, or, if they do, they are subject to early abortions. They are,
therefore, useless alike for the dairy and for the feeder, unless the removal
of the ovaries subdues the sexual ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>citement, when, in the absence of
tuberculous disease elsewhere, they may be fattened for the butcher.</p>

<p>Among the other sources of irritation charged with causing nymphomania are
tumors and cancers of the womb, rigid closure of the neck of the womb so that
conception can not occur and the frequent services by the male which stimulate
the unsatisfied appetite, inflammation, and a purulent discharge from the womb
or vagina.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment in each case will vary with the
cause and is most satisfactory when that cause is a removable one. Overfeeding
on richly nitrogenous feed can be stopped, exercise in the open field given,
diseased ovaries may be removed (see "Castration," <a href="#Page_299">p. 299</a>),
catarrhs of the womb and passages overcome by antiseptic, astringent injections
(see "Leucorrhea," <a href="#Page_224">p. 224</a>), and tumors of the womb
may often be detached and extracted, the mouth of that organ having been first
dilated by sponge tents or otherwise. The rubber dilator (impregnator),
sometimes helpful in the mare, is rarely available for the cow, owing to the
different condition of the mouth of the womb.</p>

<h4>DIMINUTION OR LOSS OF VENEREAL DESIRE (ANAPHRODISIA).</h4>

<p>This occurs in either sex from low condition and ill health. Longstanding,
chronic diseases of important internal organs, leading to emaciation and
weakness, or a prolonged semistarvation in winter may be sufficient cause. It
is, however, much more common as the result of degeneration or extensive and
destructive disease of the secreting organs (testicles, ovaries) which
elaborate the male and female sexual products, respectively. Such diseases are,
therefore, a common cause of sterility in both sexes. The old bull, fat and
lazy, becomes sluggish and unreliable in serving, and finally gets to be
useless for breeding purposes. This is not attributable to his weight and
clumsiness alone, but largely to the fatty degeneration of his testicles and
their excretory ducts, which prevents the due formation and maturation of the
semen. If he has been kept in extra high condition for exhibition in the show
ring, this disqualification comes upon him sooner and becomes more
irremediable.</p>

<p>Similarly the overfed, inactive cow, and above all the show cow, fails to
come in heat at the usual times, shows little disposition to take the bull, and
fails to conceive when served. Her trouble is the same in kind, namely, fatty
degeneration of the ovaries and of their excretory ducts (Fallopian tubes),
which prevents the formation or maturation of the ovum or, when it has formed,
hinders its passage into the womb. Another common defect in such
old, fat cows is a rigid closure of the mouth of the womb, which prevents
conception, even if the ovum reaches the interior of that organ and even if the
semen is discharged into the vagina.</p>

<p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<em>Preventive</em>&mdash;The true preventive of such conditions is to be found in a
sound hygiene. The breeding animal should be of adult age, neither overfed nor
underfed, but well fed and moderately exercised; in other words, the most
vigorous health should be sought, not only that a strong race may be
propagated, but that the whole herd, or nearly so, may breed with certainty.
Fleming gives 79 per cent as the general average of cows that are found to
breed in one year. Here more than a fifth of the progeny is sacrificed and a
fifth of the product of the dairy. With careful management the proportion of
breeders should approach 100 per cent. The various local and general obstacles
to conception should be carefully investigated and removed. The vigorous health
which comes from a sufficiently liberal diet and abundant exercise should be
solicited, and the comparative bloodlessness and weakness which advance with
undue fattening should be sedulously avoided. In bull or cow which is becoming
unduly fat and showing indications of sexual indifference, the treatment must
be active. Turning out on a short pasture where it must work hard for a living
will often suffice. The bull which can not be turned out to pasture may
sometimes be utilized in the yoke or tread power, or he may be kept a part of
his time in a field or paddock chained by the ring in his nose to a strong wire
extending from one side of the lot to the other and attached securely to two
trees or posts. The wire should be higher than the back of the bull, which will
move frequently from end to end. If he is indisposed to take sufficient
exercise in this way he may be safely driven. An instance of the value of the
exercise in these incipient cases of fatty degeneration is often quoted. The
cow Dodona, condemned as barren at Earl Spencer's, was sold cheap to Jonas
Webb, who had her driven by a road a distance of 120 miles to his farm at
Wilbraham, soon after which she became pregnant. In advanced cases, however, in
which the fatty degeneration is complete, recovery is impossible.</p>

<p>In case of rigid closure of the mouth of the womb the only resort is
dilatation. This is far more difficult and uncertain in the cow than in the
mare. The neck of the womb is longer, is often tortuous in its course, and its
walls so approximated to each other and so rigid that it may be all but
impossible to follow it, and there is always danger of perforating its walls
and opening into the cavity of the abdomen, or, short of that, of causing
inflammation and a new, rigid, fibrous formation which on healing leaves
matters worse than before. The opening must be carefully made with the finger,
and when that has entered the womb further dilatation may be effected by
inserting a sponge tent or by careful stretching with a mechanical dilator.

<h4>STERILITY FROM OTHER CAUSES.</h4>

<p>The questions as to whether a bull is a sure stock getter and whether a cow
is a breeder are so important that it would be wrong to pass over other
prominent causes of sterility. Breeding at too early an age is a common source
of increasing weakness of constitution which has existed in certain breeds.
Jerseys have especially been made the victims of this mistake, the object being
to establish the highest milking powers in the smallest obtainable body which
will demand the least material and outlay for its constant repair of waste.
With success in this line there has been the counterbalancing disadvantage of
impaired vigor, with too often lessened fertility as well as increased
predisposition to disease. When the heifers of the race have for generation
after generation been bred under a year old, the demand for the nourishment of
the fetus is too great a drain on the immature animal, which accordingly
remains small and stunted. As it fails to develop in size, so every organ fails
to be nourished to perfection. Similarly with the immature bull put to too many
cows; he fails to develop his full size, vigor, or stamina, and transfers his
acquired weakness to his progeny. An increasing number of barren females and an
increasing proclivity to abortions are the necessary results of both courses.
When this early breeding has occurred accidentally it is well to dry up the dam
just after calving, and to avoid having her served again until full grown.</p>

<p>Some highly fed and plethoric females seem to escape conception by the very
intensity of the generative ardor. The frequent passage of urine, accompanied
by contractions of the womb and vagina and a profuse secretion from their
surfaces, leads to the expulsion of the semen after it has been lodged in the
genital passages. This may be remedied somewhat by giving 1&frac12; pounds of Epsom
salt a day or two before she comes in heat, and subjecting her at the same time
to a spare diet. Should the excessive ardor of the cow not be controllable in
this way, she may be shut up for a day or two, until the heat is passing off,
when under the lessened excitement the semen is more likely to be retained.</p>

<p>The various diseases of the ovaries, their tubes, the womb, the testicles
and their excretory ducts, as referred to under "Excess of venereal desire,"
are causes of barrenness. In this connection it may be said that the discharges
consequent on calving are fatal to the vitality of semen introduced before
these have ceased to flow; hence service too soon after calving, or that of a
cow which has had the womb or genital passages injured so as to keep up a
mucopurulent flow until the animal comes in heat, is liable to fail of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
conception. Any such discharge should be first arrested by repeated injections
as for leucorrhea, after which the male may be admitted.</p>

<p>Feeding on a very saccharine diet, which greatly favors the deposition of
fat, seems to have an even more direct effect in preventing conception during
such regimen. Among other causes of barrenness are all those that favor
abortion, ergoted grasses, smutty wheat or corn, laxative or diuretic drinking
water, and any improper or musty feed that causes indigestions, colics, and
diseases of the urinary organs, notably gravel; also savin, rue,
cantharides, and all other irritants of the bowels or kidneys.</p>

<p>Hermaphrodites are barren, of course, as their sexual organs are not
distinctively either male or female. The heifer born as a twin with a bull is
usually hermaphrodite and barren, but the animals of either sex in which
development of the organs is arrested before they are fully matured remain as
in the male or female prior to puberty, and are barren. Bulls with both
testicles retained within the abdomen may go through the form of serving a cow,
but the service is unfruitful; the spermatozoa are not fully elaborated. So I
have examined a heifer with a properly formed but very small womb and an
extremely narrow vagina and vulva, the walls of which were very muscular, that
could never be made to conceive. A post-mortem examination would probably have
disclosed an imperfectly formed ovary incapable of bringing ova to maturity.</p>

<p>A bull and cow that have been too closely inbred in the same line for
generations may prove sexually incompatible and unable to generate together,
though both are abundantly prolific when coupled with animals of other
strains.</p>

<p>Finally, a bull may prove unable to get stock, not from any lack of sexual
development, but from disease of other organs (back, loins, hind limbs), which
renders him unable to mount with the energy requisite to the perfect
service.</p>

<h4>CONGESTION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLES (ORCHITIS).</h4>

<p>This visually results from blows or other direct injuries, but may be the
result of excessive service or of the formation of some new growth (tumor) in
the gland tissue. The bull moves stiffly, with straddling gait, and the right
or left half of the scrotum in which the affected testicle lies is swollen,
red, and tender, and the gland is drawn up within the sac and dropped again at
frequent intervals. It may be treated by rest; by 1&frac12; pounds Epsom salt given
in 4 quarts of water; by a restricted diet of some succulent feed; by continued
fomentations with warm water by means of sponges or rags sustained by a sling
passed around the loins and back between the hind legs. The pain may be allayed
by smearing with a solution of opium or of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153"
id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>extract of belladonna. Should a soft
point appear, indicating the formation of matter, it may be opened with a sharp
lancet and the wound treated daily with a solution of a teaspoonful of carbolic
acid in a half pint of water. Usually, however, when the inflammation has
proceeded to this extent, the gland will be ruined for purposes of procreation
and must be cut out. (See "Castration," <a href="#Page_299">p. 299</a>.)</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE SHEATH.</h4>

<p>While this may occur in bulls from infection during copulation and from
bruises, blows, and other mechanical injuries, the condition is more common in
the ox in connection with the comparative inactivity of the parts. The sheath
has a very small external opening, the mucous membrane of which is studded with
sebaceous glands secreting a thick, unctuous matter of a strong, heavy odor.
Behind this orifice is a distinct pouch, in which this unctuous matter is
liable to accumulate when the penis is habitually drawn back. Moreover, the
sheath has two muscles (protractors) which lengthen it, passing into it from
the region of the navel, and two (retractors) that shorten it, passing into it
from the lower surface of the pelvic bones above. (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX</a>, fig.
2.) The protractors keep the sheath stretched, so that it habitually covers
the penis, while the retractors shorten it up in the act of service, so that
the penis can project to its full extent. In stud bulls the frequent protrusion
of the erect and enlarged penis and the retraction and dilation of the opening
of the sheath serve to empty the pouch and prevent any accumulation of
sebaceous matter or urine. In the ox, on the other hand, the undeveloped and
inactive penis is usually drawn back so as to leave the anterior preputial
pouch empty, so that the sebaceous matter has space to accumulate and is never
expelled by the active retraction of the sheath and protrusion of the erect
penis in service. Again, the ox rarely protrudes the tip of the penis in
urination, the urine is discharged into the preputial pouch and lodges and
decomposes there, so that there is a great liability to the precipitation of
its earthy salts in the form of gravel. The decomposing ammoniacal urine, the
gritty crystals precipitated from it, and the fetid, rancid, sebaceous matter
set up inflammation in the delicate mucous membrane lining the passage. The
membrane is thickened, reddened, rendered friable, and ultimately ulcerated,
and the now narrowed sheath is blocked by the increasing mass of sebaceous and
urinous material and the decomposing mucus and pus. The penis can no longer be
protruded, the urine escapes in a small stream through the narrowing sheath,
and finally the outlet is completely blocked and the urine distends the back
part of the sheath. This will fluctuate on being handled, and soon the
unhealthy inflammation extends on each side of it, causing <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>a thick, doughy,
tender swelling under the belly and between the thighs. The next step in the
morbid course is overdistention of the bladder, with the occurrence of colicky
pains, looking at the flanks, uneasy movements of the hind limbs, raising or
twisting of the tail, pulsatory contractions of the urethra under the anus, and
finally a false appearance of relief, which is caused by rupture of the
bladder. Before rupture takes place the distended bladder may press on the
rectum and obstruct the passage of the bowel dejections. Two mistakes are
therefore probable&mdash;first, that the bowels alone are to be relieved, and,
second, that the trouble is obstruction of the urethra by a stone. Hence
the need of examining the sheath and pushing the finger into its opening to see that
there is no obstruction there, in all cases of retention of urine,
overdistended bladder, or blocked rectum in the ox. The disease may be acute or
chronic&mdash;the first by reason of acute, adhesive inflammation blocking the
outlet, the second by gradual thickening and ulceration of the sheath and
blocking by the sebaceous and calculous accretion.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment of this affection depends on the stage. If
recent and without instant danger of rupture of the bladder, the narrow opening
of the sheath should be freely cut open in the median line below, and the sac
emptied out with a finger or spoon, after which it should be thoroughly washed
with tepid water. To make the cleansing more thorough a catheter or a small,
rubber tube may be inserted well back into the sheath, and water may be forced
through it from a syringe or a funnel inserted into the other end of the tube
and considerably elevated. A fountain syringe, which should be in every house,
answers admirably. The sheath may be daily washed out with tepid water, with a
suds made with Castile soap, or with a weak solution of sulphate of zinc
(one-half dram to a quart of water). If these attentions are impossible, most
cases, after cleansing, will do well if merely driven through clean water up to
the belly once a day.</p>

<p>In case the disease has progressed to absolute obstruction, with the bladder
ready to rupture any moment, no time must be lost in opening into the urethra
with a sharp knife over the bony arch under the anus, where the pulsations are
seen in urinating. This incision is best made in the median line from above
downward, but in the absence of a skillful operator a transverse incision with
a sharp knife over the bone in the median line until the urine flows with a
gush is better than to let the patient die. Considerable blood will be lost and
the wound will heal tardily, but the ox will be preserved. Then the slitting
and cleansing of the sheath can be done at leisure, as described above. If the
bladder is ruptured, the case is hopeless.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE SHEATH AND PENIS FROM BRUISING.</h4>

<p>This also is an affection of work oxen, caused by the pressure and friction
of the sling when the animals are held in stocks for shoeing. This crushing of
both sheath and penis for half an hour or more leads to the development, some
hours later, of a hard, hot, and painful swelling, extending from the scrotum
as far as the opening of the sheath. Fever sets in, with dry muzzle, red eyes,
hard, full, rapid pulse, accelerated breathing, and elevated temperature. The
ox stands obstinately with his hind legs drawn apart and urine falling drop by
drop from the sheath. Appetite and rumination are suspended. In twenty-four
hours there may be indications of advancing gangrene (mortification), the
swelling becomes cold, soft, and doughy; it may even crack slightly from
the presence of gas; a reddish brown, fetid liquid oozes from the swelling,
especially around the edges, and if the animal survives it is only with a great
loss of substance of the sheath and penis.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;The prevention of such an injury is easy. It is only
necessary to see that the slings do not press upon the posterior part of the
abdomen. They must be kept in front of the sheath.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment, to be effective, must be prompt and judicious.
Put around the patient a strap with soft pads in contact with the affected
parts, constantly soaked in cold water for at least 24 hours. A pound or two of
Epsom salt in 4 quarts of hot water should also be given. The second day the
parts may be washed with 1 quart of witch-hazel (extract), 2 drams sugar of
lead, and 1 ounce laudanum, or the cold-water irrigations may be continued if
the active inflammation persists. In case the swelling continues hard and
resistant, it may be pricked at the most prominent points to the depth of
one-third of an inch with a lancet first dipped in dilute carbolic acid, and
the whole surface should be washed frequently with some antiseptic solution.</p>

<p>When softening occurs in the center of a hard mass and fluctuation can be
felt between two fingers pressed on different parts of such softening, it
should be freely opened to let out the putrid pus, and the cavity should be
syringed often with antiseptic solution.</p>

<p>In bad cases extensive sloughs of dead skin, of the whole wall of the
sheath, and even of the penis, may take place, which will require careful
antiseptic treatment. The soaking of the urine into the inflamed and softened
tissue and the setting up of putrefactive action not only endanger great
destruction of the tissues from putrid inflammation, but even threaten life
itself from a general blood poisoning (septicemia). Every case should have
skillful treatment to meet its various phases, but in the severe ones this is
most urgently demanded.</p>

<p>
<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE URETHRA.</h4>

<p>Like other males, the bull sometimes suffers from inflammation of the canal
which conveys the urine through the penis, and a whitish mucopurulent discharge
forms in consequence. It may have originated in gravel, the excitement of too
frequent service, infection from a cow with leucorrhea, or from extension of
inflammation from the sheath. Besides the oozing of the whitish liquid from the
end of the penis and sheath, there is tenderness and pain when handled, and
while there is no actual arrest of the urine, its flow is subject to frequent
voluntary checks, as the scalding liquid irritates the tender surface.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If recognized before the discharge sets in, a dose of
1&frac12; pounds of Epsom salt and local, warm fomentations would be appropriate. After
the onset of the whitish discharge a daily injection of a solution of 20 grains
of permanganate of potassium in a pint of water into the penis will be
beneficial.</p>

<h4>WARTS AND PAPILLARY GROWTHS ON THE PENIS.</h4>

<p>These are not frequent in bull or ox. They may interfere with the protrusion
of the organ from its sheath or with service, and always give rise to a
bad-smelling discharge.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;They may be twisted off with a pair of small tweezers or
cut off with a pair of scissors, and the seat burned with a pencil of lunar
caustic. To get hold of the penis in the bull, bring him up to a cow. In the ox
it will be necessary to push it out by manipulation through the sheath. In
difficult cases the narrow opening of the sheath may be slit open.</p>

<h4>WOUNDS OF THE PENIS.</h4>

<p>The most common wounds are those sustained by blows of horns, sticks, etc.
The blood vessels and sacs are ruptured to a greater or less extent and
considerable swellings filled with coagulated blood and inflammatory products
occur, leading to distortion of the organ, and it may be to the impossibility
of protruding it.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A lotion of a dram of alum in a quart of water may be
applied (injected into the sheath, if necessary), and a large sponge constantly
irrigated by a stream of cold water may be kept applied by means of a surcingle
to the outer side of the sheath. Incisions are rarely applicable to an organ of
this kind, but in case of the existence of an extensive clot which is unlikely
to be absorbed the lancet may be resorted to. If the injury leads to paralysis
of the penis and hanging out of its sheath, it should be supported in a sling
and astringents used freely until inflammation subsides. Then the restoration
of power may be sought by a blister between <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157"
id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>the thighs, by the use of electricity, or by
the careful use of nerve stimulants, such as strychnin, 1 grain twice daily.</p>

<h4>ULCERS ON THE PENIS.</h4>

<p>Sores on the penis of the bull may result from gravel or sebaceous masses in
the sheath or from having served a cow having leucorrhea.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;These may be treated by frequent injections into the sheath
of a lotion made with 1 dram sugar of lead, 60 drops carbolic acid, and 1 quart
water.</p>

<h4>POLYPUS OF THE VAGINA OR UTERUS.</h4>

<p>A polypus is a tumor growing from the mucous membrane, and often connected
to it by a narrow neck. A definite cause can not always be assigned. If growing
in the vagina, a polypus may project as a reddish, rounded tumor from the
vulva, especially during the act of passing water. It can be distinguished from
descent of the womb by the absence of the orifice of that cavity, which can be
felt by the oiled hand beyond the tumor in the depth of the vagina. From a
vaginal hernia caused by the protrusion of some abdominal organ enveloped by
the relaxed wall of the vagina it may be distinguished by its persistence, its
firm substance, and the impossibility of returning it into the abdomen by
pressure. A hernia containing a portion of bowel gurgles when handled and can
be completely effaced by pressure, the gut passing into the abdomen.</p>

<p>A polypus in the womb is less easily recognized. At the time of calving it
may be felt through the open mouth of the womb and recognized by the educated
touch (it must be carefully distinguished from the mushroom-formed cotyledons
(<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII</a>, fig. 2), to which in ruminants the fetal
membranes are attached). At other times, unless the womb is opened in the
effort to expel it, the polypus can be detected only by examining the womb with
the oiled hand introduced through the rectum.</p>

<p>Polypi may cause a mucopurulent discharge or they may only be suspected when
they prove an obstacle to parturition. The best way to remove them is to put
the chain of an Ã©craseur around the neck, or pedicle, of the tumor and tear it
through; or the narrow neck may be torn through by the emasculator, or in an
emergency it may be twisted through by rotating the tumor on its axis. The
removal of the tumor will allow calving to proceed; after this the sore may be
treated by a daily injection of one-half dram sulphate of zinc, 1 dram carbolic
acid, and 1 quart milk-warm water.</p>

<h4>SIGNS OF PREGNANCY.</h4>

<p>If a cow remains for three or four weeks after service without showing signs
of heat (bulling), she is probably pregnant. There <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>are very exceptional cases
in which the well-fed cow will accept the bull weeks or months after actual
conception, and others equally exceptional in which the well-thriven but
unimpregnated female will refuse the male persistently, but these in no way
invalidate the general rule.</p>

<p>The bull, no matter how vigorous or how ardent his sexual instinct, can not
be made to pay any attention to a cow which is not in heat; hence indications of
pregnancy can be had from both the male and female side. When she has
conceived, the cow usually becomes more quiet and docile, and lays on flesh and
fat more rapidly, especially during the first four months of gestation. The
stimulus to digestion and nutrition created by the demands of the growing
fetus, added to the quieter and more uneventful life, contributes to this
result. Some feeders avail themselves of this disposition to prepare heifers
and cows speedily for the butcher.</p>

<p>The enlargement of the abdomen, and its dropping so that it bulges below and
to each side, while it falls in at the flank, between the outer angle of the
hip bone and the last rib, are significant features which, though they may be
caused by abdominal tumor or dropsy, are usually marks of pregnancy. From the
same increasing weight of the abdomen the spine in the region of the loins
sinks so that the bones of the croup seem to rise, especially back toward the
root of the tail. In the early stages of pregnancy the udder develops slowly,
and toward its completion quite rapidly. For a long time there is merely a
sense of greater fullness when handled; the wrinkles in the skin become
shallower and are effaced, and the teats are materially enlarged. Beginning a
few weeks after conception, this tends to a steady development, though slight
alternations in the sense of successive growth and shrinkage are not uncommon.
In milking cows this does not hold, as the milk usually tends to a steady
diminution and the udder shrinks slowly until near the completion of the
period, when it undergoes its sudden, remarkable development, and yields at
first a serous liquid and then the yellow colostrum, which coagulates when
heated. As pregnancy advances the mucous membrane lining the vulva becomes
swollen and of a darker, bluish-red hue; the mucous secretion also increases,
becoming very abundant just before calving. When the feeding has not been
altered or restricted, a steady diminution of the salts of lime excreted in the
urine is an attendant on pregnancy, the lime being demanded for the growing
body of the fetus.</p>

<p>After the fifth month the movements of the calf may often be observed in the
right flank, nearly in front of the stifle, when the cow is drinking cold
water. The sensation of cold on the side of the first stomach, which lies to
the left and directly below the womb (<a href="#PLATE_I">Pl. I</a>), stimulates
the calf to active movements, which are detected on the <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>sudden jerking outward
of the abdominal wall as if from blows delivered from within. In a loose,
pendent abdomen in the latter months of gestation the skin may often be seen
pushed out at a sharp angle, irrespective of the period of drinking.</p>

<p>Another mode of examination through the flank is by touch. The palm of the
hand is pressed strongly inward, about 8 inches in front of the stifle and a
little below, several times in succession, and is then brought to rest with the
pressure maintained. Presently there are felt distinct and characteristic
movements of the fetus, which has been disturbed and roused to action. Another
mode is to press the closed fist strongly inward in the same situation and hold
it so, forming a deep indentation in the abdominal wall. Presently the knuckles
are felt to be struck by a solid body, which is no other than the fetus that
has been displaced to the left by the push of the hand, and now floats back in
its liquid covering (amniotic fluid; see <a href="#PLATE_XII">Pl. XII</a>)
downward and to the right.</p>

<p>Of all the modes of examination by touch, that done through the rectum gives
the earliest satisfactory indications. The hand and arm, well oiled, are
introduced, and the excrement having been removed if necessary, the palm of the
hand is turned downward and the floor of the pelvis carefully examined. There
will be felt in the median line the pear-shaped outline of the bladder, more or
less full, rounded or tense, according to the quantity of urine it contains.
Between this and the hand will be felt a soft, somewhat rounded tubular body,
which divides in front into two smaller tubes or branches, extending to the
right and left into the abdomen. This is the womb, which in its virgin, or
unimpregnated, condition is of nearly uniform size from before backward, the
main part or body being from 1&frac12; to 2 inches across, and the two anterior
branches or horns being individually little over an inch wide. Immediately
after conception the body and one of the horns begin to enlarge, the vacant
horn remaining disproportionately small, and the enlargement will be most
marked at one point, where a solid, rounded mass indicates the presence of the
growing embryo. In case of twins, both horns are enlarged. At a more advanced
stage, when the embryo begins to assume the form of the future animal, the
rounded form gives place to a more or less irregular nodular mass, while later
still the head, limbs, and body of the fetus may be distinctly made out. The
chief source of fallacy is found in the very pendent abdomen of certain cows,
into which in advanced gestation the fetus has dropped so low that it can not
be felt by the hand in the rectum. The absence of the distinct outline of the
vacant womb, however, and the clear indications obtained on external
examination through the right flank will serve to prevent any mistake. The
fetus may still be felt through <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160"
id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>the rectum if the abdomen is raised by a sheet
passed from side to side beneath it.</p>

<p>Still another sign is the beating of the fetal heart, which may be heard in
the latter half of pregnancy when the ear is pressed on the flank in front of
the right stifle or from that downward to the udder. The beats, which are best
heard in the absence of rumbling, are about 120 a minute and easily
distinguished from any bowel sounds by their perfect regularity.</p>

<h4>DURATION OF PREGNANCY.</h4>

<p>From extended statistics it is found that the average duration of pregnancy
in the cow is 285 days. A calf born at the two hundred and fortieth day may
live, and Dietrichs reported a case of a calf born on the three hundred and
thirty-fifth day, and another was reported by the American Journal of Medical
Science as having been born on the three hundred and thirty-sixth day. It is
the general observation that in most cases of prolonged pregnancies the
offspring are males. Lord Spencer found a preponderance of males between the
two hundred and ninetieth and the three hundredth days, but strangely enough
all born after the three hundredth day under his observation were females. It
may be reasonably inferred that while the prevailing tendency is to carry the
males overtime, yet that the smaller and comparatively much less developed
female sometimes fails to stimulate the womb to contraction until very far
beyond the regular date.</p>

<h4>HYGIENE OF THE PREGNANT COW.</h4>

<p>Among domestic animals considerations of hygiene must be made subservient to
profit, and therefore the first consideration is not to obtain the most robust
health, but such a measure of vigor and stamina as is compatible with the most
profitable utilization of the animal. The breeding cow must carry a calf every
year, and this notwithstanding that she is at the same time suckling another
large, growing calf. The dairy cow must breed every year, and at the same time
must furnish a generous flow of milk from nine to eleven months yearly. If her
health is lowered thereby or her life shortened, the question of profit must
still hold sway, and, when disqualified, she must yield her place to another.
There are exceptions, of course, but this rule generally holds.</p>

<p>There are certain points, however, in which the interests of hygiene may be
considered. The pregnant cow should have exercise, and as <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>regards both exercise
and feed, nothing is better than a run on a smooth pasture. She should be
withheld from all violent excitement, hunting with dogs, riding or being ridden
by cows in heat, driving in herd rapidly through narrow gateways, causing to
jump ditches or fences, subjecting to blows with the horns of pugnacious
cattle, driving on icy or otherwise slippery ground, carrying in railroad cars,
kicking by vicious attendants, and fastening or throwing down for operations.
The diet should be good, not of a kind to fatten, but with a generous quantity
of nitrogenous constituents which will favor both the yield of milk and the
nourishment of the fetus. Aliments like wheat bran, middlings, etc., which are
rich in lime and phosphates, can be used to advantage, as there is a constant
drain of earthy salts for the building of the body of the calf, and thereby the
danger of undue concentration of the urine is lessened. Hard, innutritious, and
indigestible aliments, musty grain or hay, partially ripened rye grass, millet,
Hungarian grass, vetches, peas, or maize are objectionable, as they are liable
to cause indigestion or even paralysis; and corn or hay affected by smut or
ergot, or that has been spoiled by wet, overripened, and rendered fibrous and
innutritious, is equally objectionable. In the main the feed should be
laxative, as costiveness and straining are liable to cause abortion. Roots and
green feed that have been frosted are objectionable, as being liable to cause
indigestion, though in their fresh condition most wholesome and desirable.
Ice-cold water should be avoided, as calculated to check the flow of
milk, to derange digestion, and to cause abortion. A good temperature for the
drink of the dairy cow is 55Â° F.</p>

<p>In the case of plethoric and heavy-milking cows of mature age and in the
prime of life, the hitherto liberal diet must be changed at the last week for
the scantiest possible fare, and the bowels must be kept open by laxatives, if
need be, if the owner would avoid milk fever. Her stall should not incline
downward from shoulder to croup, lest the pressure of the abdominal organs
should produce protrusion or abortion. She should be kept aloof from all causes
of acute diseases, and all existing diseases should be remedied speedily and
with as little excitement of the abdominal organs as possible. Strong
purgatives and diuretics are to be especially avoided, unless it is in the very
last days of gestation in very plethoric cows.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>PROTRUSION OF THE VAGINA (PROLAPSUS VAGINÃ).</h4>

<p>During pregnancy this is common from chronic relaxation of the vaginal walls
and from lying in stalls that are lower behind than in front. The protrusion is
of a rounded form and smooth, and if it embraces both sides of the canal it is
double, with a passage between. It may sometimes be remedied by raising the
hind part of the stall higher than the front part. This failing, a truss may be
applied as for eversion of the womb, and worn until the period of calving
approaches. (<a href="#PLATE_XXII">Pls.&nbsp;XXII</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a>.)</p>

<h4>HERNIA (BREACH) OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p>In advanced pregnancy this occurs usually from a gradual relaxation and
distention of the lower wall of the abdomen in the region of the udder, so that
the latter is displaced downward, and in the sac above and in front of it may
be felt the form and movements of the fetus. In other cases the womb escapes
through a great laceration of the abdominal muscles to one side of the udder,
and the hernial mass extends down to one side of that organ. However unsightly,
this often allows the animal to complete its pregnancy naturally, and a broad,
supporting bandage placed around the abdomen is about all that can be
recommended. After calving it is best to fatten the cow.</p>

<h4>CRAMPS OF THE HIND LIMBS.</h4>

<p>The compression of the nerves by the womb and fetus passing through the
pelvis sometimes causes cramp and inability to move the limb, but it disappears
under friction and motion and is never seen after calving.</p>

<h4>DROPSY OF THE HIND LIMBS AND BETWEEN THE THIGHS.</h4>

<p>In the latter months of pregnancy the hind legs may swell beneath the hocks,
or a soft swelling which pits on pressure with the finger appears from the
vulva down between the thighs to the udder and in front. It is mainly
ascribable to the pressure of the enlarged womb on the blood vessels, is not
dangerous, and disappears after calving.</p>

<h4>DROPSY OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE FETUS (DROPSY OF THE WOMB).</h4>

<p>The unimpregnated womb may be filled with a dropsical fluid, but the
pregnant womb is more liable to become overdistended by an excess of fluid in
the inner water bag in which the fetus floats. (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Pl.
XII</a>.) From an unhealthy state of this membrane or of blood of the fetus
(water blood) this liquid may go on accumulating until the cow seems almost as
broad as she is long. If the trouble has not originated in the ill health of
the cow, the result is still to draw on her system, overtax her strength, and
derange her digestion, so that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>the result may prove fatal to both mother and
offspring. On the other hand, I have known extreme cases that came to the
natural term without help and produced a living calf, after which the dam did
well. The natural resort is to draw off a portion of the fluid through a hollow
needle passed through the neck of the womb or through its tense wall adjacent.
This may be repeated several times, as demanded, to relieve the cow from the
injurious distention.</p>

<h4>PARALYSIS OF THE HIND PARTS.</h4>

<p>In ill-fed, weak, unthrifty cows palsy of the hind limbs and tail may appear
in the last weeks of pregnancy. The anus and rectum may participate in the
palsy so far as to prevent defecation, and the rectum is more or less
completely impacted. Exposure to wet and cold are often accessory causes,
though the low condition, general weakness, and the pressure on the nerves
going to the hind limbs are not to be forgotten. Something may be done for
these cases by a warm, dry bed, an abundant diet fed warm, frictions with straw
wisps or with a liniment of equal parts of oil of turpentine and sweet oil on
the loins, croup, and limbs, by the daily use of ginger and gentian, by the
cautious administration of strychnia (1 grain twice daily), and by sending a
current of electricity daily from the loins through the various groups of
muscles in the hind limbs. The case becomes increasingly hopeful after calving,
though some days may still elapse before the animal can support herself upon
her limbs.</p>

<h4>EXTRAUTERINE GESTATION (FETUS DEVELOPING OUTSIDE THE WOMB).</h4>

<p>These curious cases are rare and are usually divided into three types: (1)
That in which the fetus is formed in or on the ovary (ovarian gestation);
(2) that in which it is lodged in the Fallopian tube, or canal between the
ovary and womb (tubal gestation); and (3) that in which it is lodged in the
abdominal cavity and attached to one or more of its contents from which it
draws its nourishment (abdominal gestation). Undoubted cases of the first and
last varieties are recorded as occurring in the cow. The explanation of such
cases is to be found in the fact that the actively moving sperm cells
(spermatozoa) thrown into the womb have made their way through the Fallopian
tubes to the ovary. If they met and impregnated an ovum in the tube, and if the
consequent growth of that ovum prevented its descent and caused its
imprisonment within the tube, it developed there, getting attached to and
drawing nourishment from the mucous walls. Such product has its development
arrested by compression by the undilatable tube, or, bursting through the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of the tube, it escapes into the abdomen and perishes. If, on the contrary, the
spermatozoa only meet and impregnate the ovum on or in the ovary, the
development may take place in the substance of the ovary, from which the fetus
draws its nourishment, or the impregnated ovum, escaping between the ovary and
the open end of the tube, falls into the abdominal cavity and becomes adherent
to and draws nourishment from some of the abdominal organs (womb, bowel, liver,
stomach, etc.).</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are those of pregnancy, which may be suddenly
complicated by inflammation (peritonitis), owing to rupture of the sac
containing the fetus; or at full term signs of calving appear, but no progress
is made; an examination with the oiled hand in the vagina or rectum finds the
womb empty and its mouth closed. Further examination will disclose the fetal
sac attached in some part of the abdominal cavity and containing the more or
less perfectly developed body of a calf. In the most hopeful cases the fetus
perishes at an early stage of gestation, becomes inclosed in a fibrous sac, and
is slowly absorbed, its soft parts becoming liquefied and removed and the bones
remaining encysted. In some cases the bones have finally sloughed into the
rectum or through an artificial opening in the side of the belly.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Little can be done in such cases except to quiet pain and
excitement by anodynes (opium, chloral, etc.) and leave the rest to nature. A
fistula discharging bones may be dilated and the bones extracted, the sac being
then washed out with a solution of 10 grains bichlorid of mercury in a quart of
water. In certain cases with a live calf a skillful operator may be justified
in cutting into the abdomen and extracting the calf with its membranes, using
the lotion just named as an antiseptic.</p>

<h4>PROLONGED RETENTION OF THE FETUS.</h4>

<p>Even when the fetus has developed within the womb it may fail to be
delivered at the proper time; labor pains have quickly subsided and the cow
resumed her usual health. In such cases the calf dies, and its soft parts are
gradually liquefied and absorbed, while its bones remain for years in the womb
inclosed in the remains of the fetal membranes. These may be expelled at any
time through the natural channels, or they may remain indefinitely in the womb,
not interfering with the general health, but preventing conception.</p>

<p>If the true condition of things is recognized at the time of the subsidence
of the labor pains, the mouth of the womb may be dilated by the fingers, by the
insertion of sponge tents, or by a mechanical dilator (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl.
XX</a>, fig. 6), the fetal membranes may be ruptured and the calf extracted.
After the removal of the calf and its membranes <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>the danger of putrid poisoning
may be obviated by injecting the antiseptic solution advised in the paragraph
above.</p>

<h4>ABORTION (SLINKING THE CALF).</h4>

<p>Technically, abortion is the term used for the expulsion of the offspring
before it can live out of the womb. Its expulsion before the normal time, but
after it is capable of an independent existence, is premature parturition. In
the cow this may be after seven and one-half months of pregnancy. Earl Spencer
failed to raise any calf born before the two hundred and forty-second day.
Dairymen use the term abortion for the expulsion of the product of conception
at any time before the completion of the full period of a normal pregnancy, and
in this sense it will be used in this article.</p>

<p>Abortion in cows is either contagious or noncontagious. It does not follow
that the contagium is the sole cause in every case in which it is present. We
know that the organized germs (microbes) of contagion vary much in potency at
different times, and that the animal system also varies in susceptibility to
their attack. The germ may therefore be present in a herd without any manifest
injury, its disease-producing power having for the time abated considerably, or
the whole herd being in a condition of comparative insusceptibility. At other
times the same germ may have become so virulent that almost all pregnant cows
succumb to its force, or the herd may have been subjected to other causes of
abortion which, though of themselves powerless to actually cause abortion, may
yet so predispose the animals that even the weaker germ will operate with
destructive effect. In dealing with this disease, therefore, it is the part of
wisdom not to rest satisfied with the discovery and removal of one specific
cause, but rather to try to find every existent cause and to obtain a remedy by
correcting all the harmful conditions.</p>

<h4>NONCONTAGIOUS ABORTION.</h4>

<p>As abortion most frequently occurs at those three-week intervals at which
the cow would have been in heat if nonpregnant, we may assume a predisposition
at such times owing to a periodicity in the nervous system and functions. Poor
condition, weakness, and a too watery state of the blood is often a
predisposing cause. This in its turn may result from poor or insufficient feed,
from the excessive drain upon the udder while bearing the calf, from the use of
feed deficient in certain essential elements, like the nitrogenous constituents
or albuminoids, from chronic, wasting diseases, from roundworms or tapeworms in
the bowels, from flat-worms (flukes, trematodes) in the liver, from worms in
the lungs, from dark, damp, unhealthful buildings, etc. In some such cases the
nourishment is so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a>
</span>deficient that the fetus dies in the womb and is expelled in
consequence. Excessive loss of blood, attended as it usually is with shock,
becomes a direct cause of abortion.</p>

<p>Acute inflammations of important organs are notorious causes of abortion,
and in most contagious fevers (lung plague, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease)
it is a common result. Affections of the chest which prevent due aeration of
the blood induce contractions of the womb, as shown experimentally by
Brown-Sequard. Pregnant women suffocated in smoke aborted in many cases.
(Retoul.)</p>

<p>Ergoted grasses have long been known as a cause of widespread abortion in
cows. The ergot is familiar as the dark purple or black, hard, spurlike growths
which protrude from the seeds of the grasses at the period of their ripening.
(<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl. V</a>.) It is especially common, in damp localities and
cloudy seasons on meadows shaded by trees and protected against the free sweep
of the winds. The same is to a large extent true of smut; hence, wet years have
been often remarkable for the great prevalence of abortions. Abortions have
greatly increased in New Zealand among cows since the introduction of rye
grass, which is specially subject to ergot. As abortion is more prevalent in
old dairying districts, the ergot may not be the sole cause in this
instance.</p>

<p>The riding of one another by cows is attended by such severe muscular
exertion, jars, jolts, mental excitement, and gravitation of the womb and
abdominal organs backward that it may easily cause abortion in a predisposed
animal.</p>

<p>Keeping in stalls that slope too much behind (more than 2 inches) acts in
the same way, the compression from lying and the gravitation backward proving
more than a predisposed cow can safely bear.</p>

<p>Deep gutters behind the stalls, into which one or both hind limbs slip
unexpectedly, strain the loins and jar the body and womb most injuriously.
Slippery stalls in which the flooring boards are laid longitudinally in place
of transversely, and on which there is no device to give a firm foothold, are
almost equally dangerous. Driving on icy ground, or through a narrow doorway
where the abdomen is liable to be jammed, are other common causes. Aborting
cows often fail to expel the afterbirth, and if this remains hanging in a
putrid condition it is most injurious to pregnant cows in the near vicinity. So
with retained afterbirth in other cows after calving. That some cows kept in
filthy stables or with slaughterhouses near by may become inured to the odors
and escape the evil results is no disproof of the injurious effects so often
seen in such cases.</p>

<p>The excitement, jarring, and jolting of a railroad journey often cause
abortion, especially as the cow nears the period of calving, and the terror or
injury of railway or other accidents proves incomparably worse.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
</p>

<p>All irritant poisons cause abortions by the disorder and inflammation of the
digestive organs, and if such agents act also on the kidneys or womb,
the effect is materially enhanced. Powerful purgatives or diuretics should
never be administered to the pregnant cow.</p>

<p>Among other causes of abortion must be named the death or the various
illnesses of the fetus, which are about as numerous as those of the adult; the
slipping of a young fetus through a loop in the navel string so as to tie a
knot which will tighten later and interrupt the flow of blood with fatal
effect, and the twisting of the navel string by the turning of the fetus until
little or no blood can flow through the contorted cord. There is in addition a
series of diseases of the mucous membrane of the womb, and of the fetal
membranes (inflammation, effusion of blood, detachment of the membranes from
the womb, fatty or other degenerations, etc.), which interfere with the supply
of blood to the fetus or change its quality so that death is the natural
result, followed by abortion.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Although the first symptoms of abortion have appeared, it
does not follow that it will go on to completion. So long as the fetus has not
perished, if the waters have not been discharged, nor the water bags presented,
attempts should be made to check its progress. Every appreciable and removable
cause should be done away with, the cow should be placed in a quiet stall
alone, and agents given to check the excitement of the labor pains. Laudanum in
doses of 1 ounce for a small cow or 2 ounces for a large one should be promptly
administered, and repeated in three or four hours should the labor pains recur.
This may be kept up for days or even weeks if necessary, though that is rarely
required, as the trouble either subsides or abortion occurs. If the laudanum
seems to lack permanency of action, use bromid of potassium, or, better,
extract of <em>Viburnum prunifolium</em> (black haw), 40 grains, at intervals of two or
three hours until five or six doses have been given.</p>

<h4>CONTAGIOUS ABORTION.</h4>

<p>Contagious abortion (also known as epizootic abortion, enzootic abortion,
and slinking of calves) is a disease affecting chiefly cattle and to a lesser
degree other domestic animals, and characterized by an inflammatory condition
of the female reproductive organs, which results in the expulsion of the
immature young.</p>

<p><em>History</em>.&mdash;This disease has been known in England and continental Europe
for many years, and descriptions of it are mentioned in the writings of Mascal,
Lafoose, Skellet, Lawrence, St. Cyr, ZÃ¼ndel, and Youatt. In the early part of
the eighteenth century British veterinarians recognized its contagiousness, but
it remained for Franck (1876), Lehnert (1878), and BrÃ¤uer (1880) to produce the
disease in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a>
</span>healthy, pregnant cows by the introduction of exudate and material
from aborting animals. Nocard (1888) isolated from the exudate between the
mucous membrane of the uterus and fetal membranes a micrococcus and a short
bacillus which were found continually in contagious abortion, but he failed to
reproduce the disease by inoculations of pure cultures of these organisms into
healthy, pregnant animals. In 1897 Bang, assisted by Stribolt, published their
findings regarding infectious abortion of cattle, in which they incriminated
Bang's bacillus of abortion as the causative agent. With pure cultures of this
bacillus they were able to produce the disease artificially and to recover the
same organism from the experimental cases. Since that time many noted
investigators, both in this country and in Europe, have confirmed these
findings.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;The Bacterium abortus of Bang is now generally recognized as
the causative agent of the disease of cattle. Formerly it was thought that
abortion was due to injury, such as blows, horn thrusts, falls, etc., or the
eating of spoiled feed and certain plants, and while this may be true in a
limited number of cases, careful investigations have demonstrated these claims
to be largely unfounded. It is now generally recognized that when abortion
occurs in herds from time to time, it is safe to assume that the disorder is of
an infectious nature and should be so treated.</p>

<p><em>Natural mode of infection</em>.&mdash;This phase of the disease is of greatest
importance for a clear understanding of the methods of prevention. Many
investigators have demonstrated that the infection is transmitted through the
digestive tract, through contaminated feed and water. The germs are taken up by
the body from the intestines with the liquid nourishment, reach the blood, and
are carried to the genital organs, where they find conditions best suited to
their development. Some assert that calves are infected in this manner by
suckling infected mothers, the germs being present in the milk, or the teats
having been contaminated by coming in contact with infective discharges. It is
claimed that infection contracted in this manner remains dormant in the body of
the calf until pregnancy begins, and then the organism, finding conditions
suitable for its development, produces the disease.</p>

<p>Abortion may occasionally be transmitted from cow to cow by direct contact.
The discharges from diseased cows, swarming with the germs, soil the external
genitals, tail, and hind quarters, and then a susceptible animal, by contact,
gets the infective material upon the vulva, the infection traveling up the
genital canal and directly infecting the uterus.</p>

<p>The belief long entertained that the female acquires the disease at the time
of copulation as a result of transference of the infection from affected to
healthy females on the genital organs of the bull <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>has failed to receive the
support of experimental evidence. The view that the disease is spread to any
great degree in this way has been largely discredited. Cows of all ages are
more or less susceptible, but young ones in first or second pregnancy most
frequently abort. A second abortion is not unusual, and a third may
occasionally occur, after which the cow usually becomes immune and thereafter
carries her calf to maturity. Heifers from aborting mothers sometimes seem to
be less susceptible than others.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Contagious abortion is a very insidious disease, developing
very slowly through several months of the gestation period, and resulting
finally in the expulsion of the immature young, this act being simply an
indication of the presence of the disease and not the disease itself. Because
of this slow development and the fact that the health of the animal is not
noticeably influenced, the presence of the disease may not be suspected until
it has gained a firm foothold in the herd. The symptoms of approaching
abortion are those preceding normal calving. In addition, there may be
observed, a few days previous to abortion, a sticky, sometimes purulent, rusty,
and odorless discharge. Abortion occurs most frequently from the third to the
seventh month, according to the number of abortions, occurring early in first
abortion, and later in each succeeding abortion until the calf is carried to
full term and the mother has become immune. It happens frequently that calves
are carried almost to full term, and are born alive, but are sickly, and soon
die. Following abortion there is a dirty, yellowish-gray mucopurulent discharge
which persists for two or more weeks. If abortion occurs early, the fetus is
passed surrounded by its membranes, but if late in the period of pregnancy, the
membranes are retained, decomposition sets in and blood poisoning, which may
cause the death of the animal, or sterility may result.</p>

<p><em>Lesions</em>.&mdash;The most characteristic change is found in the uterus where a
dark-brown fluid, purulent or even gluey in consistency, and containing
grayish-white flakes separates the material membranes from those of the fetus,
preventing that intimate contact between the two which is so necessary for the
interchange of fluids and gases by which the fetus is nourished and by which it
obtains its oxygen. These being cut off, the fetus must of course die. The
germs producing the disease are found in greatest numbers at this point. In
addition there may be inflammatory changes, first in the walls of the uterus
and then in the tissues of the fetus. These inflammatory changes seem most
intense in the cotyledons and result in the destruction of the minute structure
of those bodies, and they appear swollen, pale, and soft. The membrane of the
uterus between the cotyledons also may show inflamed and necrotic patches.</p>

<p><em>Complications</em>.&mdash;Serious results sometimes follow abortion, and this is
particularly the case when there is retained afterbirth. <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>The retained membranes
decompose, the poisonous products of decomposition and the organisms of
decomposition themselves are absorbed, blood poisoning results, and the animal
dies. Sometimes, when the animal is able to resist the effects of this
decomposition, the uterus becomes the seat of such severe changes that
sterility results. The walls of that organ become thickened and hard, the
lining membranes become eroded, and conception can not take place. At other
times the ovaries, where the reproductive cells originate, become affected and
lose their function. Abortion does not invariably follow infection, but the
calf is carried to full term. In these cases, however, retained afterbirth is a
common occurrence, even to the extent that frequent retention of afterbirth in
a herd may be taken as an indication of the presence of the disease. Very often
suppurative processes persist for a long time, preventing conception, or
sterility may result without apparent cause. A sterile cow is valueless, of
course, for any purpose except for beef. Such animals are a source of infection
for the others and should not be allowed to remain in the herd.</p>

<p><em>Diagnosis</em>.&mdash;The diagnosis of infectious abortion is made from the
changes occurring in the fetal membranes and in the expelled fetus. This,
however, is substantiated with certainty only by microscopic demonstration of
the germ of abortion. The fact that repeated abortions are observed in a herd
is also evidence of the presence of the disease. In consideration, however, of
the fact that animals may be affected with the disease and disseminate the
germs, even though they carry the fetus to full time, a diagnosis in such
instances is only possible by laboratory methods. For this purpose the
agglutination and also the complement-fixation tests are being used with
splendid results, and by the aid of these biological tests it is possible to
determine all infected animals in a herd. The tests are carried out with the
serum from animals to be examined, only a teaspoonful of serum being necessary
for the execution of both of these tests. It, however, has to be confined to
laboratories which are properly equipped for such work.</p>

<p><em>Treatment and prevention</em>.&mdash;It may be said in general that treatment is
without avail and all efforts should be directed toward prevention. Various
medicinal agents, such as carbolic acid administered subcutaneously and
methylene blue fed in large quantities, have been recommended, but have failed
to stand the tests of scientific investigation and practical use. Serums and
vaccines have also been prepared and sold as cures and preventives, but the
work is still considered in the experimental stage.</p>

<p>Bacterial vaccines are at present extensively used in the control of this
disease, and while numerous reports indicate beneficial re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171"
id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>sults from their administration, in other
instances total failures have been recorded. It appears that the experiments
in this line have not progressed sufficiently to justify definite conclusions.</p>

<p>The spread of the disease can be controlled to a great degree by the
practice of sanitary measures directed toward the disinfection of premises and
the isolation of animals at time of calving and aborting. For methods of
disinfection of premises see page 363.</p>

<p>Make frequent observations of the animals of affected herds for symptoms of
aborting, such as swelling of vulva or udder enlargement, and upon the
discovery of an animal showing these symptoms place her immediately in a stall
which is somewhat remote from healthy stock as a means of confining the
products of abortion as much as possible should the act occur. If an animal
aborts unexpectedly she should be removed to separate quarters and given proper
attention as promptly as possible. The fetus, afterbirth, provided it has been
expelled, and all litter that has been contaminated with them and uterine
discharges should be gathered up and destroyed either by burning or burying.
Clean and thoroughly disinfect the floor, gutters, and manger in the vicinity
of the aborting animal.</p>

<p>Daily irrigations of the uterus with nonirritating antiseptic solutions,
such as 0.5 per cent solution of cresol or compound solution of cresol, at body
temperature have a tendency to prevent the multiplication of microorganisms in
the uterus and in this way promote recovery. Douching of the uterus should be
continued until the discharge ceases. In addition, the external genitals, root
of the tail, escutcheon, etc., should be sponged daily with the antiseptic
solution.</p>

<p>Aim to place all pregnant animals in disinfected individual pens or stalls a
few days before they are expected to calve, and confine them to these quarters
for three or four weeks following the delivery of the calf, or as long
thereafter as uterine discharges are observed. Avoid carrying infection from
the maternity stalls to other portions of stable, on shoes or otherwise. This
may be prevented to some degree by the use of disinfectant solutions on shoes
after the stalls have been entered or by wearing rubbers while in the maternity
stalls, removing them after the isolated animals have been attended to. The
isolation of cows at time of calving and the aborting animal is based upon the
knowledge that the fetus, afterbirth, and uterine discharges of an affected
animal at these times very frequently contain myriads of the abortion bacteria,
and that unless these substances are confined and promptly destroyed an
abundant opportunity is provided for the contamination of the food substances
of the healthy animals and their contraction of the disease.</p>

<p>Refrain from breeding fresh cows for a period of six weeks to two months
following calving. The aborting animal should be isolated for a period of six
weeks to two months and under no consideration be permitted to mingle with the
rest of the herd as long as uterine discharges are observed.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Douching of the external genitals of the bull, a practice formerly regarded
as highly important for preventing the spread of the disease, is now recognized
as being of doubtful value. The bull is protected from abortion infection to a
great degree by permitting him to serve only such animals as have calved or
aborted from six weeks to two months previously. Investigational work has
indicated that when the bull is affected with the disease the organs of his
generative system commonly involved are not reached by the antiseptic
solutions. A more rational method for the prevention of the spread of the disease
by the bull consists in keeping him in an inclosure separate from the females
and in having all services take place on neutral ground.</p>

<p>Great care should be used in purchasing cattle, and cows not known to be
free from the disease should be kept in separate quarters until this point is
determined.</p>

<h4>GRANULAR VENEREAL DISEASE (INFECTIOUS GRANULAR VAGINITIS).</h4>

<p>The affection to which the foregoing names have been given is a chronic,
mild, and apparently contagious disease of cattle, characterized by an
inflammatory condition of the mucous membrane of the vagina and the development
of nodules upon its surface.</p>

<p>This disease is very widely spread, but from an economic point of view it
does not appear to have great significance. Williams, who investigated it,
asserts that it is difficult to find a single herd in this country which is
free of this disease. He considers it of great importance, claiming that
granular vaginitis has a vital relation to abortion. This view, however, is not
substantiated by other investigators, it being now generally accepted that the
disease is only rarely responsible for abortion, and further, that it exerts no
apparent ill effects on the health of the animal and that it has no effect on
the milk yield.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Natural infection may take place either by direct contact of
animals or at the time of service. Most of the cows in the affected herd
contract the disease, but the bulls are rarely or very mildly affected. The
inflamed condition of the membranes of the vagina results in a catarrhal
exudate, and this discharge, which soils the external genitals and the tail,
and the uneasiness and sometimes the straining of the animal, are the first and
most prominent symptoms observed. Upon examination, small, hard, grayish
nodules can be seen and felt upon the inflamed membranes. This acute stage may
last for three or four weeks, then it gradually subsides and assumes the
chronic form, only to flare up again as the animal comes in heat.</p>

<p>These nodules are sometimes found on the membranes of the uterus, and some
investigators have argued from this fact that it was responsible for abortion
and sterility. Others, however, deny this and point out that the bacillus of
abortion can be demonstrated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">
[Pg 173]</a></span>in nearly every case. The importance of the disease is
therefore in dispute and the decision must be left to future investigation.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The exaggerated importance which has been attached to this
disease resulted in the exploitation of the most varied kinds of remedies for
its treatment. It is true that with a protracted and laborious treatment it is
possible to effect cures in from one to three months, but with our present
knowledge of this disorder it is advisable to limit the treatment to animals
which show an acute inflammatory condition of the vagina and vulva with a
discharge as a result of the granular affection. The treatment should be local
and confined to the application of antiseptic washes in the form of
irrigations. For this purpose a 0.5 per cent solution of the compound solution
of cresol or of Lugol's solution has been found satisfactory.</p>

<h4>PARTURITION (CALVING).</h4>

<h5>SYMPTOMS OF CALVING.</h5>

<p>In the cow the premonitions of calving are the enlargement of the udder,
which becomes firm and resistant to the touch, with more or less swelling in
front, and yields a serous, milky fluid; the enlargement and swelling of the
vulva, which discharges an abundant, stringy mucus; the drooping of the belly,
and the falling in of the muscles at each side of the root of the tail, so as
to leave deep hollows. When this last symptom is seen, calving may be counted
on in 24 hours or in 2 or 3 days. When the act is imminent, the cow becomes
uneasy, moves restlessly, leaves off eating, in the field leaves the herd, lies
down and rises again as if in pain, shifts upon her hind feet, moves the tail,
and may bellow or moan. When labor pains come on the back is arched, the croup
drooped, the belly is drawn up, and straining is more or less violent and
continuous. Meanwhile blood may have appeared on the vulva and tail, and soon
the clear water bags protrude between the lips of the vulva. They increase
rapidly, hanging down toward the hocks, and the fore or hind feet can be
detected within them. With the rupture of the bags and escape of the waters the
womb contracts on the solid, angular body of the fetus and is at once
stimulated to more violent contractions, so that the work proceeds with
redoubled energy to the complete expulsion. This is why it is wrong to rupture
the water bags if the presentation is normal, as they furnish a soft, uniform
pressure for the preliminary dilation of the mouth of the womb and passages, in
anticipation of the severe strain put upon them as the solid body of the calf
passes.</p>

<p>The cow often calves standing, in which case the navel string is broken as
the calf falls to the ground. If, however, she is recumbent, this cord is torn
through as she rises. The afterpains come on 3 or 4 hours later and expel the
membranes, which should never be left longer than 24 hours.</p>

<h5>NATURAL PRESENTATION.</h5>

<p>When there is but one calf the natural presentation is that of the fore feet
with the front of the hoofs and knees turned upward to<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ward the tail of the dam
and the nose lying between the knees. (<a href="#PLATE_XV">Pl. XV</a>.) If
there are twins the natural position of the second is that of the hind feet,
the heels and hocks turned upward toward the cow's tail. (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl. XVIII</a>, fig. 1.)
In both of these natural positions the curvature of the body of the calf&mdash;
the back arched upward&mdash;is the same with the curvature of the passages,
which descend anteriorly into the womb, ascend over the brim of the pelvis,
and descend again toward the external opening (vulva). Any presentation differing
from the above is abnormal.</p>

<h5>OBSTACLES TO PARTURITION.</h5>

<p>With a well-formed cow and calf and a natural presentation as above, calving
is usually prompt and easy. Obstacles may, however, come from failure of the
mouth of the womb to dilate; from twisting of the neck of the womb; from tumors
in the vagina; from dropsy in the womb or abdomen; from overdistention of the
rectum or bladder; from undue narrowing of the passages; from excess of fat in
the walls of the pelvis; from the disturbance of a nervous cow by noises; from
stone or urine in the bladder; from wrong presentation of the calf, its back
being turned downward or to one side in place of upward toward the spine of the
dam; from the bending backward of one or more limbs or of the head into the
body of the womb; from presentation of the back, shoulder, or croup, all four
limbs being turned back; from presentation of all four feet at once; from
obstruction caused by an extra head or extra limbs, or double body on the part
of the offspring (<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX</a>); from dropsy or other
disease of the calf; from excessive or imperfect development of the calf; from
the impaction of twins into the passages at the same time; or at times it may
be from the mere excessive volume of the fetus.</p>

<h5>GENERAL MAXIMS FOR THE ASSISTANT CONCERNING DIFFICULT PARTURITION.</h5>

<p>Do not interfere too soon. "Meddlesome midwifery is bad" with animals as
with women. After labor pains set in, give a reasonable time for the water bags
to protrude and burst spontaneously, and only interfere when delay suggests
some mechanical obstruction. If there is no mechanical obstruction, let the
calf be expelled slowly by the unaided efforts of the cow. Bruises and
lacerations of the passages and flooding from the uncontracted womb may come
from the too speedy extraction of the calf. When assistance is necessary, the
operator should dress in a thick flannel shirt from which the sleeves have been
cut off clear to the shoulders. This avoids danger of exposure and yet leaves
the whole arm free and untrammeled. Before inserting the hand it and the arm
should be smeared with oil, lard, or vaseline, care being taken that the oil or
lard is fresh, neither salted nor rancid, and that it has been purified by
boiling or rendered antiseptic by the addition of a teaspoonful of carbolic
acid to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
pound. This is a valuable precaution against infecting the cow by
introducing putrid ferments into the passages and against poisoning of the arm
by decomposing discharges in case the calving is unduly protracted. When labor
pains have lasted some time without any signs of the water bags, the dropping
in at the sides of the rump, and the other preparations for calving being
accomplished, the hand should be introduced to examine. When the water
bags have burst and neither feet nor head appear for some time, examination
should be made. When one fore foot only and the head appear, or both fore feet
without the head, or the head without the fore feet, examine. If one hind foot
appears without the other, make examination. The presenting limb or head should
be secured by a rope with a running noose, so that it may not pass back into
the womb and get lost during the subsequent manipulations, but may be retained
in the vagina or brought up again easily. In searching for a missing member it
is usually better to turn the head of the cow downhill, so that the gravitation
of the fetus and abdominal organs forward into the belly of the cow may give
more room in which to bring up the missing limb or head. If the cow is lying
down, turn her on the side opposite to that on which the limb is missing, so
that there may be more room for bringing the latter up. Even if a missing limb
is reached, it is vain to attempt to bring it up during a labor pain. Wait
until the pain has ceased and attempt to straighten out the limb before the
next pain comes on. If the pains are violent and continuous, they may be
checked by pinching the back or by putting a tight surcingle around the body in
front of the udder. These failing, 1 ounce or 1&frac12; ounces of chloral hydrate
in a quart of water may be given to check the pains. If the passages have dried
up or lost their natural, lubricating liquid, smear the interior of the
passages and womb and the surface of the calf, so far as it can be reached,
with pure fresh lard; or pure sweet oil may be run into the womb through a
rubber tube (fountain syringe). In dragging upon the fetus apply strong
traction only while the mother is straining, and drag downward toward the hocks
as well as backward. The natural curvature of both fetus and passages is thus
followed and the extraction rendered easier.</p>

<h5>LABOR PAINS BEFORE RELAXATION OF THE PASSAGES.</h5>

<p>Any of the various causes of abortion may bring on labor pains before the
time. Straining comes on days or weeks before the time, and there is not the
usual enlargement, swelling, and mucous discharge from the vulva. There is
little or no falling in by the sides of the root of the tail; the abdomen has
not dropped to the usual extent, and the udder is less developed and yields
little or no milk. In spite of the pains no water bags appear, and the oiled
hand cau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
tiously introduced into the vagina finds the neck of the womb firmly
closed, rigid, and undilatable. If it is known that the cow has not reached her
proper time of calving, the examination through the vagina should be omitted
and the animal should be placed in a dark, quiet place by herself, and be given
1 to 2 ounces laudanum. <em>Viburnum prunifolium</em> (black haw), 1 ounce, may be
added, if necessary, and repeated in three hours. The pains will usually
subside.</p>

<p>In some instances the external parts are relaxed and duly prepared, but the
neck of the womb remains rigidly closed. In such case the solid extract of
belladonna should be smeared around the constricted opening and the animal left
quiet until it relaxes.</p>

<h5>DISEASED INDURATION OF THE MOUTH OF THE WOMB.</h5>

<p>From previous lacerations or other injuries the neck of the womb may have
become the seat of fibrous hardening and constriction, so as to prevent its
dilatation, when all other parts are fully prepared for calving. The enlarged,
flabby vulva, the sinking at each side of the rump, the full udder, and
drooping abdomen indicate the proper time for calving, but the labor pains
effect no progress in the dilatation of the mouth of the womb, and the oiled
hand introduced detects the rigid, hard, and, in some cases, nodular feeling of
the margins of the closed orifice which no application of belladonna or other
antispasmodic suffices to relax. Sponge tents may be inserted or the mechanical
dilator (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 6) may be used if there is
opening enough to admit it, and if not, a narrow-bladed, probe-pointed knife
(<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 2) may be passed through the orifice and
turned upward, downward, and to each side, cutting to a depth not exceeding a
quarter of an inch in each case. This done, a finger may be inserted, then two,
three, and four, and finally all four fingers and thumb brought together in the
form of a cone and made to push in with rotary motion until the whole hand can
be introduced. After this the labor pains will induce further dilation, and
finally the presenting members of the calf will complete the process.</p>

<h5>TWISTING OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB.</h5>

<p>This is not very uncommon in the cow, the length of the body of the womb and
the looseness of the broad ligaments that attach it to the walls of the pelvis
favoring the twisting. It is as if one were to take a long sack rather loosely
filled at the neck and turn over its closed end, so that its twisting should
occur in the neck. The twist may be one-quarter round, so that the upper
surface would come to look to one side, or it may be half round, so that what
was the upper surface becomes the lower. The relation of the womb of the cow to
the upper and right side of the paunch favors the twisting. The <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>paunch occupies
the whole left side of the abdomen and extends across its floor to the right
side. Its upper surface thus forms an inclined plane, sloping from the left
downward and to the right, and on this sloping surface lies the pregnant
womb.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how, in the constant movements of the paunch upon its
contents and the frequent changes of position of the growing fetus within the
womb, to say nothing of the contractions of the adjacent bowels and the more or
less active movements of the cow, the womb should roll downward to the right.
Yet in many cases the twist is toward the left, showing that it is not the
result of a simple rolling downward over the paunch, but rather of other
disturbances. The condition may be suspected when labor pains have continued
for some time without any sign of the water bags, and it is confirmed when the
oiled hand, introduced through the vagina, finds the mouth of the womb soft and
yielding, but furnished with internal folds running forward in a spiral manner.
If the folds on the upper wall of the orifice run toward the right, the womb
is twisted to the right; if, on the contrary, they turn toward the left, it
indicates that the womb is turned over in that direction. The direction of the
twist must be known before treatment can be undertaken. Then, if the twist is
toward the right, the cow is laid upon her right side with her head downhill,
the hand of the operator is introduced through the spirally constricted neck of
the womb, and a limb or other portion of the body of the calf is seized and
pressed firmly against the wall of the womb. Meanwhile two or three assistants
roll the cow from her right side over on her back to her left side. The object
is to hold the womb and calf still while the body of the cow rolls over. If
successful, the twist is undone, its grasp on the wrist is slackened, and the
water bags and calf press into the now open passage. If the first attempt does
not succeed, it is to be repeated until success has been attained. If the
spiral folds on the upper wall of the opening turn toward the left, the cow is
laid on her left side and rolled over on her back and on to the right side, the
hand being, as before, within the womb and holding the fetus, so that all may
not rotate with the cow. In introducing the hand it will usually be found
needful to perforate the membranes, so that a limb of the calf may be seized
direct and firmly held. Among my occasional causes of failure with these cases
have been, first, the previous death and decomposition of the fetus, leading to
such overdistention of the womb that it could not be made to rotate within the
abdomen, and, second, the occurrence of inflammation and an exudate on the
twisted neck of the womb, which hindered it from untwisting.</p>

<p>In obstinate cases, in which the hand can be made to pass through the neck
of the womb easily, additional help may be had from the use of the instrument
shown in <a href="#PLATE_XX">Plate XX</a>, figure 5. Two cords, with run<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>ning nooses, are successively
introduced and made fast on two limbs of the calf; the cords are then passed
through the two rings on the end of the instrument, which is passed into the
womb and the cords drawn tight and fixed round the handle. Then, using the
handle as a lever, it is turned in the direction opposite to the twist. The
hand should meanwhile be introduced into the womb and the snared limbs seized
and pressed against its walls so as to secure the rotation of the uterus along
with the body of the fetus. The relaxation of the constriction and the
effacement of the spiral folds will show when success has been gained, and the
different members at one end of the body should then be brought up so as to
secure a natural presentation.</p>

<h5>NARROW PELVIS FROM FRACTURE OR DISEASE.</h5>

<p>In a small cow the pelvis may be too narrow to pass a calf sired by a bull
of a large breed, but this is exceptional, as the fetus usually accommodates
itself to the size of the dam and makes its extra growth after birth. When the
pelvic bones have been fractured repair takes place with the formation of a
large permanent callus, which, projecting internally, may be a serious obstacle
to calving. Worse still, if the edge of the broken bone projects internally as
a sharp spike or ridge, the vaginal walls are cut upon it during the
passage of the calf, with serious or fatal result. In other cases, where the
cow has suffered from fragility of bone (fragilitas ossium) the thickening of
the bone causes narrowing of the long passage of the pelvis and the crumbling
fractures poorly repaired, with an excess of brittle new material, may form an
insuperable obstacle to parturition. Cows affected in any of these ways should
never again be bred, but if they do get pregnant and reach full time a careful
examination will be necessary to determine whether natural parturition can take
place or if the calf must be extracted in pieces. (See "Embryotomy," p.
202.)</p>

<h5>OBSTRUCTION BY MASSES OF FAT.</h5>

<p>This is not unknown in old cows of the beef breeds, the enormous masses of
fat upon and within the pelvis being associated with weakness or fatty
degeneration of the muscles. If the presentation is natural, little more is
wanted than a judicious traction upon the fetus to compress and overcome the
soft resisting masses.</p>

<h5>OBSTRUCTION BY A FULL BLADDER OR RECTUM OR BY STONE.</h5>

<p>In all cases of delayed or tardy parturition the evacuation of rectum and
bladder is important, and it is no less so in all difficult parturitions. Stone
in the bladder is fortunately rare in the cow, but when present it should be
removed to obviate crushing and perhaps perforation of the organ during
calving.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
</p>

<h5>CALVING RETARDED BY NERVOUSNESS.</h5>

<p>In a public fair ground I have seen labor pains begin early in the day and
keep up in a weak and insufficient manner for many hours, until the stall was
thoroughly closed in and the cow secluded from the constant stream of visitors
and the incessant noise, when at once the pains became strong and effective and
the calf was soon born.</p>

<h5>COAGULATED BLOOD UNDER THE VAGINAL WALLS.</h5>

<p>This is common after calving, but sometimes occurs before, as the result of
accidental injury. The mass may be recognized by its dark hue and the doughy
sensation to the touch. It may be cut into and the mass turned out with the
fingers, after which it should be washed frequently with an antiseptic lotion
(carbolic acid 1 dram in 1 quart of water).</p>

<h5>CONSTRICTION OF A MEMBER BY THE NAVEL STRING.</h5>

<p>In early fetal life the winding of the navel string around a limb may cause
the latter to be slowly cut off by absorption under the constricting cord. So
at calving the cord wound round a presenting member may retard progress
somewhat, and though the calf may still be born tardily by the unaided efforts
of the mother, it is liable to come still-born, because the circulation in the
cord is interrupted by compression before the offspring can reach the open air
and commence to breathe. If, therefore, it is possible to anticipate and
prevent this displacement and compression of the navel string it should be
done, but if this is no longer possible, then the extraction of the calf should
be effected as rapidly as possible, and if breathing is not at once attempted
it should be started by artificial means.</p>

<h5>WATER IN THE HEAD OF THE CALF (HYDROCEPHALUS).</h5>

<p>This is an enormous distention of the cavity holding the brain, by reason of
the accumulation of liquid in the internal cavities (ventricles) of the brain
substance. The head back of the eyes rises into a great rounded ball (<a
href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX</a>, figs. 4 and 5), which proves an insuperable
obstacle to parturition. The fore feet and nose being the parts presented, no
progress can be made, and even if the feet are pulled upon the nose can not by
any means be made to appear. The oiled hand introduced into the passages will
feel the nose presenting between the fore limbs, and on passing the hand back
over the face the hard rounded mass of the cranium is met with. A sharp-pointed
knife or a cannula and trocar should be introduced in the palm of the hand and
pushed into the center of the rounded mass so as to evacuate the water. The
hand is now used to press together the hitherto distended but thin and fragile
walls, and the calf may be delivered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180"
id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>in the natural way. If the enlarged head
is turned backward it must still be reached and punctured, after which it must
be brought up into position and the calf delivered.</p>

<p>If the hind feet present first, all may go well until the body and shoulders
have passed out, when further progress is suddenly arrested by the great bulk
of the head. If possible, the hand, armed with a knife or trocar, must be
passed along the side of the shoulder or neck so as to reach and puncture the
distended head. Failing in this, the body may be skinned up from the belly and
cut in two at the shoulder or neck, after which the head can easily be reached
and punctured. If in such case the fore limbs have been left in the womb, they
may now be brought up into the passage, and when dragged upon the collapsed
head will follow.</p>

<p>If the distention is not sufficient to have rendered the bony walls of the
cranium thin and fragile, so that they can be compressed with the hand after
puncture, a special method may be necessary. A long incision should be made
from behind forward in the median line of the cranium with an embryotomy knife
(<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig. 1) or with a long embryotome (<a
href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 3). By this means the bones on the one side
are completely separated from those on the other and may be made to overlap and
perhaps to flatten down. If this fails they may be cut from the head
all around the base of the rounded cranial swelling by means of a guarded
chisel (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 8) and mallet, after which there
will be no difficulty in causing them to collapse.</p>

<h5>DROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN OF THE CALF (ASCITES).</h5>

<p>This is less frequent than hydrocephalus, but no less difficult to deal
with. With an anterior presentation the fore limbs and head may come away
easily enough, but no effort will advance the calf beyond the shoulders. The
first thought should be dropsy of the belly, and the oiled hand introduced by
the side of the chest will detect the soft and fluctuating yet tense sac of the
abdomen. If there is space to allow of the introduction of an embryotomy knife,
the abdomen may be freely cut with this, when the fluid will escape into the
womb and parturition may proceed naturally. If this can not be effected, a long
trocar and cannula may be passed between the first two ribs and straight on
beneath the spine until it punctures the abdomen. (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl.
XVIII</a>, fig. 2.) Then the trocar is to be withdrawn and the liquid will flow
through the cannula and will be hastened by traction on the fore limbs. In the
absence of the trocar and cannula, two or three of the first ribs may be cut
from the breastbone, so that the hand may be introduced through the chest to
puncture the diaphragm with an embryotomy knife and allow an escape of the
water. In some slighter cases a tardy delivery may take place without puncture,
the liquid bulging forward into the chest as the abdomen is <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>compressed in the
pelvic passages. With a posterior presentation the abdomen may be punctured
more easily either in the flank or with a trocar and cannula through the
anus.</p>

<h5>GENERAL DROPSY OF THE CALF.</h5>

<p>This occurs from watery blood or disease of some internal organ, like the
liver or kidney, and is recognized by the general puffed-up and rounded
condition of the body, which pits everywhere on pressure but without crackling.
If not too extreme a case, the calf may be extracted after it has been very
generally punctured over the body, but usually the only resort is to extract it
in pieces. (See "Embryotomy," <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>.)</p>

<h5>SWELLING OF THE CALF WITH GAS.</h5>

<p>This is usually the result of the death and decomposition of the fetus when
extraction has been delayed for a day or more after the escape of the waters.
It is impossible to extract it whole, owing to its large size and the dry state
of the skin of the calf, the membranes, and the wall of the womb. These dry
surfaces stick with such tenacity that no attempt at traction leads to any
advance of the calf out of the womb or into the passages. When the fetus is
advanced the adherent womb advances with it, and when the strain is relaxed
both recede to where they were at first. The condition may be helped somewhat
by the free injection of oil into the womb, but it remains impossible to
extract the enormously bloated body, and the only resort is to cut it in pieces
and extract it by degrees. (See "Embryotomy," <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>.)</p>

<h5>RIGID CONTRACTIONS OF MUSCLES.</h5>

<p>In the development of the calf, as in after life, the muscles are subject to
cramps, and in certain cases given groups of muscles remain unnaturally short,
so that even the bones grow in a twisted and distorted way. In one case the
head and neck are drawn round to one side and can not be straightened out, even
the bones of the face and the nose being curved around to that side. In other
cases the flexor muscles of the fore legs are so shortened that the knees are
kept constantly bent and can not be extended by force. The bent neck may
sometimes be sufficiently straightened for extraction by cutting across the
muscles on the side to which it is turned, and the bent knees by cutting the
cords on the back of the shank bones just below the knees. If this fails, there
remains the resort of cutting off the distorted limbs or head. (See
"Embryotomy," <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>.)</p>

<h5>TUMORS OF THE CALF (INCLOSED OVUM).</h5>

<p>Tumors or new growths grow on the unborn calf as on the mature animal, and
by increasing the diameter of the body render its prog<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>ress through the passage
of the pelvis impossible. In my experience with large, fleshy tumors of the
abdomen, I have cut open the chest, removed the lungs and heart, cut through
the diaphragm with the knife, and removed the tumor piecemeal by alternate
tearing and cutting until the volume of the body was sufficiently reduced to
pass through. Where this failed it would remain to cut off the anterior part of
the body, removing as much of the chest as possible, and cutting freely through
the diaphragm; then, pushing back the remainder of the body, the hind limbs may
be seized and brought into the passages and the residue thus extracted. The
tumor, unless very large, will get displaced backward so as not to prove an
insuperable obstacle.</p>

<p>In many cases the apparent tumor is a blighted ovum which has failed to
develop, but has grafted itself on its more fortunate twin and from it has
drawn its nourishment. These are usually sacs containing hair, skin, muscle,
bone, or other natural tissues, and only exceptionally do they show the
distinct outline of the animal.</p>

<h5>MONSTROSITY IN THE CALF.</h5>

<p>As a monstrous development in the calf may hinder calving, it is well to
consider shortly the different directions in which these deviations from the
natural form appear. Their origin and significance will be rendered clearer if
we divide them according to the fault of development in individual cases.
Monsters are such&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) From absence of parts&mdash;absence of head, limb, or other
organ&mdash;arrested development.</p>

<p>(2) From some organ being unnaturally small, as a dwarfed head, limb, trunk,
etc.&mdash;arrested development.</p>

<p>(3) From unnatural division of parts&mdash;cleft lips, palate, head, trunk,
limbs, etc.&mdash;abnormal growth.</p>

<p>(4) From the absence of natural divisions&mdash;absence of mouth, nose,
eye, anus; the cloven foot of ox or pig becomes solid, like that of the horse,
etc.&mdash;confluence of parts which are rightfully separate.</p>

<p>(5) From the fusion of parts&mdash;both eyes replaced by central one, both
nostrils merged into one central opening, etc.&mdash;confluence of parts.</p>

<p>(6) From unnatural position or form of parts&mdash;curved nose, neck, back,
limbs, etc.&mdash;lack of balance in the growth of muscles during
development.</p>

<p>(7) From excessive growth of one or more organs&mdash;enormous size of head,
double penis, superfluous digits, etc.&mdash;redundancy of growth at given
points.</p>

<p>(8) From imperfect differentiation of the sexual organs&mdash;hermaphrodites
(organs intermediate between male and female), male organs with certain
feminine characters, female organs with certain well-marked male characters.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
</p>

<p>(9) From the doubling of parts or of the entire body&mdash;double monsters,
doubled heads, doubled bodies, extra limbs, etc.&mdash;redundant development.
(<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX</a>, figs. 1, 2, 3.)</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;The causes of monstrosities are varied. Some, like extra
digits, lack of horns, etc., run in families, which produce them with absolute
certainty when bred in the direct line, although they were originally acquired
peculiarities which have merely been fixed by long habit in successive
generations. The earliest horse had five toes, and even the most recent fossil
horse had three toes, of which the two lateral ones are still represented in
the modern animal by the two splint bones. Yet if our horse develops an extra
toe it is pronounced a monstrosity. A more genuine monstrosity is the
solid-hoofed pig, in which two toes have been merged into one. Another of the
same kind is the solid shank bone of the ox, which consists of two bones united
into one, but which are still found apart in the early fetus. Though originally
acquired peculiarities, they now breed as invariably as color or form.</p>

<p>Other monstrosities seem to have begun in too close breeding, by which the
powers of symmetrical development are impaired, just as the procreative power
weakens under continuous breeding from the closest blood relations. A
monstrosity consisting in the absence of an organ often depends on a simple
lack of development, the result of disease or injury, as a young bone is
permanently shortened by being broken across the soft part between the shaft
and the end, the only part where increase in length can take place. As the
result of the injury the soft, growing layer becomes prematurely hard and all
increase in length at that end of the bone ceases. This will account for some
cases of absence of eye, limb, or other organ.</p>

<p>Sometimes a monstrosity is owing to the inclosure of one ovum in another
while the latter is still but a soft mass of cells and can easily close around the
first. Here each ovum has an independent life; they develop simultaneously,
only the outer one having direct connection with the womb and being furnished
with abundant nourishment advances most rapidly and perfectly, while the
inclosed and starved ovum is dwarfed and imperfect often to the last degree.</p>

<p>In many cases of excess of parts the extra part or member is manifestly
derived from the same ovum, and even the same part of the ovum, being merely
the effect of a redundancy and vagary of growth. Such cases include most
instances of extra digits or other organs, and even of double monsters, as
manifested by the fact that such extra organs grow from the normal identical
organs. Hence the extra digit is attached to the normal digit, the extra head
to the one neck, the extra tail to the croup, extra teeth to the existing
teeth, and even two similarly formed bodies are attached by some point common
to both, as the navels, breastbones, backs, etc. (<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX</a>,
figs. 1, 2, 3.) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
184]</a></span>This shows that both have been derived from the same
primitive layer of the embryo, which possessed the plastic power of building up
a given structure or set of organs. An inclosed ovum, on the other hand, has no
such identity or similarity of structure to the part with which it is
connected, showing an evident primary independence of both life and the power
of building tissues and organs. The power of determining extra growth along a
given natural line is very highly developed in the early embryo and is equally
manifest in the mature examples of some of the lower forms of animal life. Thus
a newt will grow a new tail when that member has been cut off, and a starfish
will develop as many new starfishes as the pieces made by cutting up the
original one. This power of growth in the embryo and in the lower form of
animals is comparable to the branching out again of a tree at the places from
which branches have been lopped. The presence of this vegetablelike power of
growth in the embryo accounts for most double monsters.</p>

<p>The influence of disease in modifying growth in the early embryo,
increasing, decreasing, distorting, etc., is well illustrated in the
experiments of St. Hilaire and Valentine in varnishing, shaking, or otherwise
disturbing the connections of eggs and thereby producing monstrosities. One can
easily understand how inflammations and other causes of disturbed circulation
in the womb, fetal membranes, or fetus would cause similar distortions and
variations in the growing fetus. It is doubtless largely in the same way that
certain mental disturbances of a very susceptible dam affect the appearance of
the progeny. The monstrosities which seriously interfere with calving are
mainly such as consist in extra members or head, which can not be admitted into
the passages at the same time, where some organ of the body has attained extra
size, where a blighted ovum has been inclosed in the body of a more perfect
one, or where the body or limbs are so contracted or twisted that the calf must
enter the passages doubled up.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Extraction is sometimes possible by straightening the
distorted members by the force of traction; in other cases the muscles or
tendons must be cut across on the side to which the body or limbs are bent to
allow of such straightening. Thus, the muscles on the concave side of a wry
neck or the cords behind the shank bones of a contracted limb may be cut to
allow of these parts being brought into the passages, and there will still be
wanting the methods demanded for bringing up missing limbs or head, for which
see paragraphs below. In most cases of monstrosity by excess of overgrowth it
becomes necessary to cut off the supernumerary or overdeveloped parts, and the
same general principles must be followed as laid down in "Embryotomy" (p.
202).</p>

<p>These include all general presentations, yet other subsidiary ones will at
once occur to the attentive reader. Thus, in each anterior or posterior
presentation, with the back of the calf turned downward or to one side, the
case may be complicated by the bending back of one or more members as a whole
or at the joint just above the shank bones (knee or hock). So also in such
anterior presentation the head may be turned back.</p>

<p>
<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Head and fore feet presented</em>&mdash;Back turned to one side.&mdash;The calf
has a greater diameter from above down (spine to breastbone) than it has from
side to side, and the same is true of the passage of the pelvis of the cow,
which measures, on an average, 8-7/10 inches from above downward and 7-9/10
inches from side to side. Hence the calf passes most easily with its back
upward, and when turned with its back to one side calving is always tardy and
may be difficult or impossible. The obvious remedy is to rotate the calf on its
own axis until its spine turns toward the spine of the cow. The operation is
not difficult if the body of the calf is not yet fixed in the passages. The
presenting feet are twisted over each other in the direction desired, and this
is continued until the head and spine have assumed their proper place. If the
body is firmly engaged in the passages the skin of the whole engaged portion
should be freely lubricated with lard, and the limbs and head twisted over each
other as above. The limbs may be twisted by an assistant when the head is
manipulated by the operator, who drags on the rope turned halfway round the
limbs and assists in the rotation with his other hand in the passages.</p>

<p><em>Head and fore feet presented</em>&mdash;Back turned down toward the
udder.&mdash;This position (<a href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 6) is
unnatural, and the parturition is difficult for two reasons: First, the natural
curvature of the fetus is opposed to the natural curvature of the passages;
and, second, the thickest part of the body of the calf (the upper) is engaged
in the narrowest part of the passage of the pelvis (the lower). Yet unless the
calf is especially large and the pelvis of the cow narrow, parturition may
usually be accomplished in this way spontaneously or with very little
assistance in the way of traction on the limbs. If this can not be
accomplished, two courses are open: First, to rotate the calf as when the back
is turned to one side; second, to push back the presenting fore limbs and head
and search for and bring up the hind limbs, when the presentation will be a
natural, posterior one.</p>

<p><em>Presentation of the hind feet with the back turned to one side or
downward</em>.&mdash;These are the exact counterparts of the two conditions last
described, are beset with similar drawbacks, and are to be dealt with on the
same general principles. (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII</a>, fig. 4.) With the
back turned to one side the body should be rotated until the back turns toward
the spine of the dam, and with the back turned down it must be extracted in
that position (care being taken that the feet do not perforate the roof of the
vagina) or it must be rotated on its own axis until the back turns upward, or
the hind limbs must be pushed back and the fore limbs and head advanced, when
the presentation will be a natural anterior one.</p>

<p><em>Impaction of twins in the passage</em>.&mdash;It is very rare to have twins enter
the passages together so as to become firmly impacted. As a rule, each of the
twins has its own separate membranes, and as the <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>water bags of one will
naturally first enter and be the first to burst, so the calf which occupied
those membranes will be the first to enter the passage and the other will be
thereby excluded. When the membranes of both have burst without either calf
having become engaged in the pelvis, it becomes possible for the fore legs of
one and the hind legs of the other to enter at one time, and if the straining
is very violent they may become firmly impacted. (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl.
XVIII</a>, fig. 1.) The condition may be recognized by the fact that two of the
presenting feet have their fronts turned forward, while the two others have
their fronts turned backward. If the four feet belonged to one natural calf,
they would all have the same direction. By means of this difference in
direction we can easily select the two feet of one calf, place running nooses
upon them just above the hoofs or fetlocks, and have an assistant drag upon the
ropes while the feet of the other calf are pushed back. In selecting one of the
twins to come first several considerations should have weight. The one that is
most advanced in the passage is, of course, the first choice. Though the fore
feet of one are presented, yet if the head is not in place the calf presenting
by its hind feet is to be chosen as being less liable to obstruct. Again, if
for either calf one limb only is presented and the other missing, the one
presenting two feet should be selected to come first. As soon as one calf has
been advanced so as to occupy the pelvis the other will be crowded back so that
it will not seriously obstruct.</p>

<p><em>Fore limbs curved at the knee</em>&mdash;Limbs sprawling outward.&mdash;In this
case not only are the knees somewhat bent in a curve, but the calf
has a position as if it rested on its breastbone, while the legs were drawn
apart and directed to the right and left. The shoulder blades being drawn
outward from the chest and the elbows turned out, the muscles extending from
the trunk to the limb are unduly stretched and keep the knees bent and the feet
directed outward so as to press on the sides of the passages. They become
retarded in their progress as compared with the more rapidly advancing head,
and may bruise or even lacerate the walls of the vagina. It would seem easy to
rectify this by extending the legs, but the already tense and overstretched
muscles operate against extension in the present position, and it is not easy
to rotate the limbs so as to apply the shoulder flat against the side of the
chest. Under these circumstances a repeller (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig.
7) may be planted in the breast and the body of the calf pushed backward
into the womb, when the limbs will extend easily under traction and the
presentation becomes at once natural.</p>

<p><em>Fore limbs curved at knee</em>&mdash;Flexor tendons shortening.&mdash;In this
case the feet will press against the floor of the pelvis though the limb has no
outward direction, and the shoulder meanwhile presses <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>against the roof of the
same passage. Unless the knees can be sufficiently straightened by force a
knife must be used to cut across the cords behind the knee, when the limbs may
be straightened sufficiently.</p>

<p><em>Fore limbs flexed at knee</em>&mdash;Flexor tendons unshortened.&mdash;This is
mostly seen in cases in which the body of the calf is in the proper position,
its back being turned up toward the back of the dam, and in cows with a
drooping abdomen. The feet have been supposed to catch beneath the brim of the
pelvis, and being retarded while the head advances into the passages, they get
bent at the knee and the nose and knees present. (<a href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>,
fig. 2.) The calf, however, is not an inanimate body advanced by the mere
contraction of the womb, but it moves its limbs freely under the stimulus of
the unwonted compression, and in moving the feet as they are advanced they slip
down over the pelvic brim and finding no other firm support they bend back
until, under the impulsion, they can no longer straighten out again. The knees,
therefore, advance with the neck and head, but the feet remain bent back. The
result is that the upper part of the limb is also flexed, and the shoulder
blade and arm bone with their masses of investing muscles are carried backward
and applied on the side of the chest, greatly increasing the bulk of this
already bulky part. As the elbow is carried back on the side of the chest, the
forearm from elbow to knee further increases the superadded masses of the
shoulder and renders it difficult or impossible to drag the mass through the
passages. When the fore limbs are fully extended, on the contrary, the shoulder
blade is extended forward on the smallest and narrowest part of the chest, the
arm bone with its muscles is in great part applied against the side of the back
part of the neck, and the forearm is continued forward by the side of the head
so that the nose lies between the knees. In this natural presentation the
presenting body of the calf forms a long wedge or cone, the increase of which
is slow and gradual until it reaches the middle of the chest.</p>

<p>The difficulty of extending the fore limbs will be in proportion to the
advance of the head through the pelvic cavity. In the early stage all that is
necessary may be to introduce the oiled hand, the left one for the right leg or
the right one for the left, and passing the hand from the knee on
to the foot to seize the foot in the palm, bend it forcibly on the fetlock, and
lift it up over the brim of the pelvis, the knee being, of course, pressed
upward against the spine. As soon as the foot has been raised above the brim of
the pelvis (into the passage) the limb can be straightened out with the
greatest ease.</p>

<p>When, however, the shoulders are already engaging in the pelvis the feet can
not thus be lifted up, and to gain room a repeller (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>,
fig. 7) must be used to push back the body of the calf. This is <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>an instrument with a long,
straight stem, divided at the end into two short branches (2 to 3 inches long)
united to the stem by hinges so that they can be brought into a line with the
stem for introduction into the womb and then spread to be implanted in the breast.
In the absence of a repeller a smooth, round, fork handle may be used, the
prongs having been removed from the other end. A third device is to have an
assistant strip his arm to the shoulder and, standing back to back with the
 perator, to introduce his right arm into the passages along with the operator's
 left (or vice versa) and push back the body of the calf while the operator
 seeks to bring up a limb. The repeller or staff having been planted safely
 in the breast of the calf, an assistant pushes upon it in a direction either
 forward or slightly upward, so as not only to follow the natural curve of the
 body and favor its turning in the line of that curve within the womb, but
 also to carry the shoulders upward toward the spine and obtain more room for
 bringing up the missing feet. It is good policy, first, to put a halter
 (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, figs. 4<em>a</em> and 4<em>b</em>) on the
 head or a noose (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig. 3) on the lower jaw
 and a rope round each limb at the knee, so as to provide against the loss of
 any of these parts when the body is pushed back into the womb. This offers
 the further advantage that by dragging upon these ropes the body can be advanced
 in the passage until the foot is reached, when the rope must be slackened and
 the repeller used to get room for bringing up the foot. If the cow is lying,
 the operator should first secure the foot on the upper side and then, if
 necessary, turn the cow on its opposite side so as to bring up the other.</p>

<p>In using the instruments some precautions are demanded. They must be
invariably warmed before they are introduced, and they should be smeared with
lard or oil to make them pass easily and without friction. The assistant who is
pushing on the instrument must be warned to stop if at any time resistance
gives way. This may mean the turning of the fetus, in which case the object of
repulsion has been accomplished, but much more probably it implies the
displacement of the instrument from the body of the fetus, and unguarded
pressure may drive it through the walls of the womb.</p>

<p>When the calf enters the passage with its back turned down toward the belly
and udder, the bending back of the fore limbs is rare, probably because the
feet can find a straighter and more nearly uniform surface of resistance in the
upper wall of the womb and the backbone, and do not slide over a crest into an
open cavity, as they do over the brim of the pelvis. The weight of the calf,
too, gravitating downward, leaves more room for the straightening of the bent
limbs, so that the desired relief is much more easily secured. The manipulation
is the same in principle, only one must add the precaution of a steady traction
on the feet in extraction, lest, owing to the adverse <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>curvature of the fetus,
the hoofs are suddenly forced through the roof of the vagina, and, perhaps, the
rectum as well, during a specially powerful labor pain.</p>

<p>When the back of the calf is turned to the right side or the left the main
difference is that in addition to straightening the limbs the fetus must be
rotated to turn its back upward before extraction is attempted. In this case,
too, it may be difficult to bring up and straighten the lower of the two limbs
until the body has been rotated into its proper position. Cord the upper
straightened limb and head, then rotate the body and search for the second
missing limb.</p>

<p><em>Fore limbs bent back from the shoulders</em>.&mdash;This is an exaggeration of
the condition just named, and is much more difficult to remedy, owing to the
distance and inaccessibility of the missing limb. It usually happens with the
proper position of the body, the back of the calf being turned toward the back
of the mother. The head presents in the passage and may even protrude from the
vulva during an active labor pain, but it starts back like a spring when the
straining ceases. Examination with the oiled hands in the intervals between the
pains fails to detect the missing limbs. (<a href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig.
1.) If, however, the hand can be introduced during a pain it may be
possible to reach the elbow or upper part of the forearm. In the absence of a
pain a halter or noose on the head may be used to advance the whole body until
the forearm can be seized just below the elbow. This being firmly held and the
head or body pushed back into the womb, room may be obtained for bringing up
the knee. The forearm is used as a lever, its upper part being strongly forced
back while its lower part is pressed forward. If a pain supervenes the hold
must be retained, and whatever gain has been made must be held if possible.
Then during the next pain, by pushing back the body and continuing to operate
the forearm as a lever, a still further advance may be made. As the knee is
brought up in this way, the hand is slid down from the elbow toward the knee,
which is finally brought up over the brim of the pelvis and into the passage.
It is now corded at the knee, and the subsequent procedure is as described in
the last article. In a large, roomy cow with a small calf the latter may pass
with one or both forelegs bent back, but this is a very exceptional case, and,
as early assistance is the most successful, there should never be delay in hope
of such a result.</p>

<p><em>One fore limb crossed over the back of the neck</em>.&mdash;This is a rare
obstacle to calving, but one that not altogether unknown. The hand introduced
into the passage feels the head and one forefoot, and farther back on the same
side of the other foot, from which the womb can be traced obliquely across the
back of the neck. (<a href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 3.) This foot,
projecting transversely, is liable to bruise or tear the vagina. If still
deeply engaged in the vagina, it may be seized <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>and pushed across to the
opposite side of the neck, when the presentation will be natural.</p>

<p><em>Head bent down beneath the neck</em>.&mdash;In this case, with drooping belly and
womb allowing the brim of the pelvis to form a ridge, the advancing calf, having
unduly depressed its nose, strikes it on the brim of the pelvis, and the neck
advancing, the head is bent back and the poll and ears either enter the pelvis
or strike against its brim. The two forefeet present, but they make no
progress, and the oiled hand introduced can detect no head until the poll is
felt at the entrance of the pelvis, between the forearms. The two forefeet must
be fixed with running nooses and dragged on moderately while the oiled hand
seeks to bring up the head. The hand is slid down over the forehead and brim of
the pelvis until the nose is reached, when it is passed into the mouth, the
muzzle resting in the palm of the hand. The legs are now pushed upon, and in
the space thus gained the muzzle is drawn up so as to enter it into the pelvis.
In doing this the operator must carefully see that the mouth does not drop open
so that the sharp, front teeth cut through the floor of the womb. Should this
danger threaten, the hand should be made to cover the lower jaw as well. The
lessened security of the hold is more than compensated by the safety of the
procedure. With the nose in the pelvis, it has only to be drawn forward and the
parturition is natural.</p>

<p><em>Head bent down beneath the breast</em>.&mdash;This is an exaggerated condition of
that last named. The head, arrested by the brim of the pelvis and already bent
back on the neck, is pressed farther with each successive throe until it has
passed between the forelegs and lodges beneath the breast bone. (<a
href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 4.) On examination, the narrow upper
border of the neck is felt between the forearms, but as a rule the head is out
of reach below. Keeping the hand on the neck and dragging on the feet by the
aid of ropes, the hand may come to touch and seize the ear, or, still better,
one or two fingers may be inserted into the orbit of the eye.</p>

<p>Then in pushing back upon the limbs, with or without the aid of a repeller
applied against the shoulder, space may be obtained to draw the head into a
vertical position, and even to slip the hand down so as to seize the nose.
Should it prove impossible to draw the head up with the unassisted fingers, a
blunt hook (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig. 6) may be inserted into the
orbit, on which an assistant may drag while another pushes upon the limbs or
repeller. Meanwhile the operator may secure an opportunity of reaching and
seizing the nose or of passing a blunt hook into the angle of the mouth.
Success will be better assured if two hooks (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig.
7) are inserted in the two orbits, so as to draw up the head more evenly.
In other cases a noose may be placed on the upper jaw, or even around both
jaws, and trac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a>
</span>tion made upon this and on the hooks in the orbits while the legs
are pushed back, and while the operator pushes back on the poll or forehead. In
still more difficult cases, in which even the orbits can not be reached, a
sharp hook on the end of a straight iron rod (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig.
2) may be inserted over the lower jaw as far forward as it can be reached,
and by dragging upon this while the body is pushed back the head will be
brought up sufficiently to allow the operator to reach the orbit or nose. If
even the jaw can not be reached, the hook may be inserted in the neck as near
to the head as possible and traction employed so as to bring the head within
reach.</p>

<p>In all such cases the cow's head should be turned downhill, and in case of
special difficulty she should be turned on her back and held there until the
head is secured. In old-standing cases, with the womb closely clasping the body
of the calf, relaxation may be sought by the use of chloroform or a full dose
of chloral hydrate&mdash;2 ounces; the free injection of warm water into the
womb will also be useful.</p>

<p><em>Head turned back on the shoulder</em>.&mdash;With a natural, anterior
presentation this may happen because of the imperfect dilation of the mouth of
the womb. Under the throes of the mother the forefeet pass through the narrow
opening into the vagina, while the nose, striking against it and unable to
enter, is pressed backward into the womb and turns aside on the right or left
shoulder. The broad muzzle of the calf forms an especial obstacle to entrance
and favors this deviation of the head. The worst form of this deviation is the
old-standing one with shortening of the muscles of the neck on that side, and
oftentimes distortion of the face and neck bones, as noticed under
"Monstrosities" (<a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>).</p>

<p>When the head is bent on the shoulder the feet appear in the natural way,
but no progress is made, and examination reveals the absence of the nose from
between the knees, and farther back, from above and between the elbows, a
smooth rounded mass is felt extending to the right or left, which further
examination will identify with the neck. Following the upper border of this the
hand reaches the crown of the head with the ears, and still further the eyes,
or even, in a small calf, the nose.</p>

<p>As the bulky head of the calf can not be extracted along with the shoulders,
it becomes necessary to push the body of the fetus back and straighten out the
head and neck. The cow should be laid with her head downhill and with that side
up toward which the head is turned. If the throes are very violent, or the womb
strongly contracted on the calf, it may be best to seek relaxation by giving
chloroform, or 2 ounces of laudanum, or 2 ounces of chloral hydrate. If the
calf or the passages are dry, sweet oil may be injected, or the whole may be
liberally smeared with fresh lard. In the absence of these, warm water rendered
slightly slippery by Castile soap may be injected into <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>the womb in quantity.
Ropes with running nooses are placed on the presenting feet and the oiled hand
introduced to find the head. If, now, the fingers can be passed inside the
lower jawbone, and drag the head upward and toward the passage, it unwinds the
spiral turn given to the neck in bending back, and greatly improves the chances
of bringing forward the nose. If, at first, or if now, the lower jaw can be
reached, a noose should be placed around it behind the incisor teeth and
traction made upon this, so that the head may continue to be turned, forehead
up, toward the spine and jaws down, thereby continuing to undo the screwlike
curve of the neck. If, on the contrary, the nose is dragged upon by a cord
passing over the upper border of the neck, the screwlike twist is increased and
the resistance of the bones and joints of the neck prevents any straightening
of the head. As soon as the lower jaw has been seized by the hand or noose, a
repeller (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 7), planted on the inside of the
elbow or shoulder most distant from the head, should be used to push back the
body and turn it in the womb, so that the head may be brought nearer to the
outlet. In this way the head can usually be brought into position and the
further course of delivery will be natural.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the lower jaw can not be reached with the hand, and then
the orbit or, less desirably, the ear, may be availed of. The ear may be pulled
by the hand, and by the aid of the repeller on the other shoulder the calf may
be so turned that the lower jaw may be reached and availed of. Better still, a
clamp (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl. XVIII</a>, figs. 3 and 4) is firmly fixed on
the ear and pulled by a rope, while the repeller is used on the opposite
shoulder, and the hand of the operator pulls on the lower border of the neck
and lifts it toward the other side. To pull on the upper border of the neck is
to increase the spiral twist, while to raise the lower border is to undo it. If
the outer orbit can be reached, the fingers may be inserted into it so as to
employ traction, or a blunt finger hook (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig.
8) may be used, or a hook with a rope attached, or, finally, a hook on the
end of a long staff. Then, with the assistance of the repeller, the body may be
so turned and the head advanced that the lower jaw may be reached and availed
of.</p>

<p>In case neither the ears nor the orbit can be reached, a cord should be
passed around the neck of the calf as near the head as possible, and traction
made upon that while the opposite shoulder is pushed toward the opposite side
by the repeller, assisted by the hand dragging on the lower border of the neck.
To aid the hand in passing a rope around the neck a cord carrier
(<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig. 5) is in use. It fails, however, to help
us in the most difficult part of the operation&mdash;the passing of the cord
down on the deep or farthest side of the neck&mdash;and to remedy this I have
devised a cord carrier, furnished with a ring at the end, a joint 6 or 8 inches
from the end, and another <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
194]</a></span>ring on the handle, close to this joint. (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 4.)
A cord is passed through both rings and a knot tied on its end, just back of
the terminal ring. The instrument, straightened out, is inserted until it reaches
just beyond the upper border of the neck, when, by dragging on the cord, the
movable segment is bent down on the farther side of the neck, and is pushed
on until it can be felt at its lower border. The hand now seizes the knotted
end of the cord beneath the lower border of the neck and pulls it through
while the carrier is withdrawn, the cord sliding through its rings. The cord,
pushed up as near to the head as possible, is furnished with a running noose
by tying the knotted end round the other, or, better, the two ends are
twisted around each other so as to give a firm hold on the neck without
dangerously compressing the blood vessels. By pushing on the opposite shoulder
with the repeller, and, assisting with the hand on shoulder, breastbone, or
lower border of the neck, such a change of position will be secured as will
speedily bring the head within reach. Afterwards proceed as described above.</p>

<p>These cases are always trying, but it is very rarely necessary to resort to
embryotomy. When absolutely required, first remove one fore limb, and then, if
still unsuccessful, the other, after which the head can easily be secured. (See
"Embryotomy," <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>.)</p>

<p><em>Head turned upward and backward</em>.&mdash;In this case the face rests upon the
spine; the forefeet appear alone in the passage, but fail to advance, and on
examination the rounded, inferior border of the neck can be felt,
extending upward and backward beneath the spine of the dam, and if the calf is
not too large the hand may reach the lower jaw or even the muzzle.
(<a href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 5.) A repeller is planted in the breast
and the body of the calf pushed backward and downward so as to make room and
bring the head nearer to the passage; or in some cases the body may be pushed
back sufficiently by the use of the fore limbs alone. Meanwhile the head is
seized by the ear or the eye socket, or, if it can be reached, by the lower
jaw, and pulled downward into position as space is obtained for it. If the hand
alone is insufficient, the blunt hooks may be inserted in the orbits or in the
angle of the mouth, or a noose may be placed on the lower paw, and by traction
the head will be easily advanced. In case of a large fetus, the head of which
is beyond reach, even when traction is made on the limbs, a rope may be passed
around the neck and pulled, while the breastbone is pressed downward and
backward by the repeller, and soon the change of position will bring the orbit
or lower jaw within reach. With the above-described position the standing
position is most favorable for success, but if the calf is placed with its back
down toward the udder, and if the head is bent down under the brim of the
pelvis, the best position for the cow is on her back, with her head
downhill.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In neglected cases, with death and putrefaction of the fetus and dryness of
the passages, it may be necessary to extract in pieces. (See "Embryotomy," p.
202.)</p>

<p><em>Outward direction of the stifles</em>&mdash;Abduction of hind limbs.&mdash;As an
obstacle to parturition, this is rare in cows. It is most liable to take place
in cows with narrow hip bones, and when the service has been made by a bull
having great breadth across the quarter. The calf, taking after the sire,
presents an obstacle to calving in the breadth of its quarters, and if at the
same time the toes and stifles are turned excessively outward and the hocks
inward the combined breadth of the hip bones above and the stifles below may be
so great that the pelvis will not easily admit them. After the forefeet, head,
and shoulders have all passed out through the vulva, further progress suddenly
and unaccountably ceases, and some dragging on the parts already delivered does
not serve to bring away the hind parts. The oiled hand introduced along the
side of the calf will discover the obstacle in the stifle joints turned
directly outward and projecting on each side beyond the bones which
circumscribe laterally the front entrance of the pelvis. The evident need is to
turn the stifles inward; this may be attempted by the hand introduced by the
side of the calf, which is meanwhile rotated gently on its own axis to favor
the change of position. To correct the deviation of the hind limb is, however,
very difficult, as the limbs themselves are out of reach and can not be used as
levers to assist. If nothing can be done by pushing the body of the calf back
and rotating it and by pressure by the hand in the passages, the only resort
appears to be to skin the calf from the shoulder back, cut it in two as far
back as can be reached, then push the buttocks well forward into the womb,
bring up the hind feet, and so deliver.</p>

<p><em>Hind limbs excessively bent on the body and engaged in the pelvis</em>.&mdash;In
this case the presentation is apparently a normal, anterior one; fore limbs and
head advanced naturally and the parturition proceeds until half the chest has
passed through the external passages, when suddenly progress ceases and no
force will effect farther advance. An examination with the oiled hand detects
the presence, in the passages, of the hind feet and usually the hind legs up to
above the hocks. (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII</a>, fig. 1.)</p>

<p>The indications for treatment are to return the hind limbs into the body of
the womb. If they have not advanced too far into the pelvis, this may be done
as follows: A rope with running noose is passed over each hind foot and drawn
tight around the lower part of the hock; the ropes are then passed through the
two rings in the small end of the rotating instrument (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl.
XX</a>, fig. 5) which is slid into the passages until it reaches the hocks,
when the ropes, drawn tight, are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196"
id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>tied around the handle of the instrument. Then
in the intervals between the pains the hocks are pushed forcibly back into the
womb. If by this means flexion can be effected in hocks and stifles, success
will follow; the hind feet will pass into the womb and clear of the brim of the
pelvis and the body may now be advanced without hindrance, the hind limbs
falling into place when the hip joints are extended. At the same time the
pressure upon hind limbs must not be relaxed until the buttocks are engaged in
the pelvis, as otherwise the feet may again get over the brim and arrest the
progress of delivery.</p>

<p>When the hind limbs are already so jammed into the pelvis that it is
impossible to return them, the calf must be sacrificed to save the mother.
Cords with running nooses are first put on the two hind feet. The body must be
skinned from the shoulders back as far as can be reached, and is to be then cut
in two, if possible, back of the last rib. The remainder of the trunk is now
pushed back into the body of the womb and by traction upon the cords the hind
feet are brought up into the passages and the extraction will be comparatively
easy.</p>

<p><em>Hind presentation with one or both legs bent at the hock</em>.&mdash;After the
bursting of the water bags, though labor pains continue, no part of the fetus
appears at the vulva unless it be the end of the tail. On examination the
buttocks are felt wedged against the spine at the entrance of the pelvis and
beneath them the bent hock joints resting on the brim of the pelvis below.
(<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII</a>, fig. 3.) The calf has been caught by the
labor pains while the limb was bent beneath it and has been jammed into or
against the rim of the pelvis, so that extension of the limb became impossible.
With the thigh bent on the flank, the leg on the thigh, and the shank on the
leg, and all at once wedged into the passage, delivery is practically
impossible.</p>

<p>The obvious remedy is to push the croup upward and forward and extend the
hind legs, and in the early stages this can usually be accomplished in the cow.
A repeller (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 7) is planted across the
thighs and pointed upward toward the spine of the cow and pushed forcibly in
this direction during the intervals between labor pains. Meanwhile the oiled
hand seizes the shank just below the hock and uses it as a lever, pushing the
body back and drawing the foot forward, thus effectually seconding the action
of the repeller. Soon a distinct gain is manifest, and as soon as the foot can
be reached it is bent back strongly at the fetlock, held in the palm of the
hand, and pulled up, while the repeller, pressing on the buttocks, assists to
make room for it. In this way the foot may be brought safely and easily over
the brim of the pelvis without any risk of laceration of the womb of the foot.
After the foot has been lifted over <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">
[Pg 197]</a></span>the brim, the whole limb can be promptly and easily extended.
In cases presenting special difficulty in raising the foot over the brim, help
may be had by traction on a rope passed around in front of the hock, and later
still by a rope with a noose fastened to the pastern. In the worst cases, with
the buttocks and hocks wedged deeply into the passages, it may prove difficult
or impossible to push the buttocks back into the abdomen, and in such case the
extension of the hind limb is practically impossible without mutilation. In
some roomy cows a calf may be dragged through the passages by ropes attached
to the bent hocks, but even when this is possible there is great risk of
laceration of the floor of the vagina by the feet. The next resort is to cut
the hamstring just above the point of the hock and the tendon on the front of
the limb (flexor metatarsi) just above the hock, and even the sinews behind
the shank bone just below the hock. This allows the stifle and hock to move
independently of each other, the one undergoing extension without entailing
the extension of the other; it also allows both joints to flex completely,
so that the impacted mass can pass through a narrower channel. If now, by
dragging on the hocks and operating with the repeller on the buttocks, the
latter can be tilted forward sufficiently to allow of the extension of the
stifle, the jam will be at once overcome, and the calf may be extracted with
the hock bent, but the stifle extended. If even this can not be accomplished,
it may now be possible to extract the whole mass with both hocks and stifles
fully bent. To attempt this, traction may be made on the rope around the hocks
and on a sharp hook (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 2) passed forward
between the thighs and hooked on to the brim of the pelvis. Everything else
 failing, the offending limb or limbs may be cut off at the hip joint and
 extracted, after which extraction may proceed by dragging on the remaining
 limb, or by hooks on the hip bones. Very little is to be gained by cutting
 off the limb at the hock, and the stifle is less accessible than the hip,
 and amputation of the stifle gives much poorer results.</p>

<p><em>Hind limbs bent forward from the hip</em>&mdash;Breech presentation.&mdash;This
is an exaggeration of the condition last described, only the hocks and stifles
are fully extended and the whole limb carried forward beneath the belly. (<a
href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII</a>, fig. 2.) The water bags appear and burst, but
nothing presents unless it may be the tail. Examination in this case detects
the outline of the buttocks, with the tail and anus at its upper part.</p>

<p>The remedy, as in the case last described, consists in pushing the buttock
upward and forward with a repeller, the cow being kept standing and headed
downhill until the thigh bone can be reached and used as a lever. Its upper end
is pushed forward and its lower end raised until, the joints becoming fully
flexed, the point of the hock can be raised above the brim of the pelvis. If
necessary a noose <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
may be passed around the leg as far down toward the hock as possible and pulled
on forcibly, while the hand presses forward strongly on the back of the leg
above. When both hocks have been lodged above the brim of the pelvis the
further procedure is as described under the last heading.</p>

<p>If, however, the case is advanced and the buttocks wedged firmly into the
passages, it may be impossible safely to push the fetus back into the womb, and
the calf must either be dragged through the passage as it is or the limbs or
the pelvis must be cut off. To extract successfully with a breech presentation
the cow must be large and roomy and the calf not too large. The first step in this
case is to separate the pelvic bones on the two sides by cutting from before
backward, exactly in the median line below and where the thighs come together
above. This may be done with a strong embryotomy knife, but is most easily
accomplished with the long embryotome (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 3).
The form which I have designed (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 1), with a
short cutting branch jointed to the main stem, is to be preferred, as the short
cutting piece may be folded on the main stem so that its cutting edge will be
covered, and it can be introduced and extracted without danger. This is pushed
forward beneath the calf's belly, and the cutting arm opened, inserted in front
of the brim of the pelvis and pulled forcibly back through the whole length of
the pelvic bones. The divided edges are now made to overlap each other and the
breadth of the haunch is materially reduced. One end of the cord may then be
passed forward by means of a cord carrier (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig.
5) on the inner side of one thigh until it can be seized at the stifle by
the hand passed forward on the outer side of that thigh. This end is now pulled
back through the vagina, the other end passed through the cord carrier and
passed forward on the inner side of the other thigh until it can be seized at
the stifle by the hand passed forward outside that thigh. This end is drawn
back through the vagina like the first, and is tied around the other so as to
form a running noose. The rope is now drawn through the ring until it forms a
tight loop, encircling the belly just in front of the hind limbs. On this
strong traction can be made without interfering with the full flexion of the
limbs on the body, and if the case is a suitable one, and the body of the fetus
and the passages are both well lubricated with oil or lard, a successful
parturition may be accomplished. A less desirable method is to put a rope
around one thigh or a rope around each and drag upon these, but manifestly the
strain is not so directly on the spine, and the limbs may be somewhat hampered
in flexion.</p>

<p>This method being inapplicable, the next resort is to cut off one or both
hind limbs at the hip joint. Free incisions are made on the side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>of the haunch
so as to expose the hip joint, and the muscles are cut away from the head of
the thigh bone down to its narrow neck, around which a rope is passed and
firmly fixed with a running noose. The joint is now cut into all around, and
while traction is made on the cord the knife is inserted into the inner side of
the joint and the round ligament severed. The cord may now be dragged upon
forcibly, and the muscles and other parts cut through as they are drawn tense,
until finally the whole member has been extracted. Traction on the rope round
the other thigh will now suffice to extract, in most cases, but if it should
fail the other limb may be cut off in the same manner, and then hooks inserted
in front of the brim of the pelvis or in the openings in the bones of its floor
(obturator foramina) will give sufficient purchase for extraction. Another method
is to insert a knife between the bone of the rump (sacrum) and the hip bone and
sever their connections; then cut through the joint (symphysis) between the two
hip bones in the median line of the floor of the pelvis, and then with a hook
in the opening on the pelvic bones (obturator foramen) drag upon the limb and
cut the tense soft parts until the limb is freed and extracted.</p>

<p><em>Presentation of the back</em>.&mdash;In this presentation straining may be
active, but after the rupture of the water bags no progress is made, and the
hand introduced will recognize the back with its row of spinous processes and
the springing ribs at each side pressed against the entrance to the pelvis. (<a
href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII</a>, fig. 6.) The presence or absence of the ribs
will show whether it is the region of the chest or the loins. By feeling along
the line of spines until the ribs are met with we shall learn that the head
lies in that direction. If, on the contrary, we follow the ribs until they
disappear, and a blank space is succeeded by hip bones, it shows that we are
approaching the tail. The head may be turned upward, downward, to the right
side, or to the left.</p>

<p>The object must be to turn the fetus so that one extremity or the other can
enter the passage, and the choice of which end to bring forward will depend on
various considerations. If one end is much nearer the outlet than the other,
that would naturally be selected for extraction, but if they are equidistant
the choice would fall on the hind end, as having only the two limbs to deal
with without any risk of complication from the head. When the head is turned
upward and forward it will usually be preferable to bring up the hind limb, as,
owing to the drooping of the womb into the abdomen, rotation of the fetus will
usually be easier in that direction, and if successful the resulting position
will be a natural posterior presentation, with the back of the calf turned
toward the rump of the cow. Similarly with the croup turned upward and forward,
that should be pushed on for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200"
id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ward, and if the forefeet and head can be secured
it will be a natural anterior presentation, with the back of the calf turned
upward toward the rump of the cow.</p>

<p>The womb should be injected with warm water or oil, and the turning of the
calf will demand the combined action of the repeller and the hand, but in all
such cases the operator has an advantage that the body of the fetus is wholly
within the body of the womb, and therefore movable with comparative ease.
No part is wedged into the pelvic passages as a complication. The general
principles are the same as in faulty presentation fore and hind, and no time
should be lost in making the manipulations necessary to bring the feet into the
pelvis, lest they get inbent or otherwise displaced and add unnecessary
complications.</p>

<p>With a transverse direction of the calf, the head being turned to one side,
the pressure must be directed laterally, so that the body will glide around on
one side of the womb, and the extremities when reached must be promptly seized
and brought into the passages. Sometimes a fortunate struggle of a live fetus
will greatly aid in rectifying the position.</p>

<p><em>Breast and abdomen presented</em>.&mdash;All four feet in the passages.&mdash;In
this form the calf lies across the womb with its roached back turned forward
and its belly toward the pelvis. All four feet may be extended and engaged in
the passages, or one or more may be bent on themselves so as to lie in front of
the pelvis. The head, too, may usually be felt on the right side or the left,
and if detected it serves to identify the exact position of the fetus. The
position may further be decided upon by examination of the feet and limbs. With
the limbs extended the front of the hoofs and the convex aspect of the bent
pasterns and fetlocks will look toward that flank in which lie the head and
shoulders. On examination still higher the smooth, even outline of the knee and
its bend, looking toward the hind parts, characterize the fore limb, while the
sharp prominence of the point of the hock and the bend on the opposite side of
the joint, looking toward the head, indicate the hind limb. (<a
href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII</a>, fig. 5.)</p>

<p>The remedy of this condition is to be sought in repelling into the womb
those limbs that are least eligible for extraction, and bringing into the
passages the most eligible extremities. The most eligible will usually be those
which project farthest into the passages, indicating the nearer proximity of
that end of the calf. An exception may, however, be made in favor of that
extremity which will give the most natural presentation. Thus if, owing to
obliquity in the position of the fetus, the hind extremities promised a
presentation with the back of the fetus turned down toward the udder, and the
anterior extremities one with the back turned up toward the spine, the latter
should be selected. Again, if the choice for the two extremities is evenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
balanced, the hind may be chosen as offering less risk of complication, there
being no head to get displaced.</p>

<p>The first step in the treatment is to place a running noose on each of the
four feet, marking those of the fore limbs to distinguish them from those of
the hind ones. In case it is proposed to bring the anterior extremities into
the passage, a noose should also be placed on the lower jaw. Then run the ropes
attached to the two feet that are to be pushed back through the ring of a cord
carrier (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, fig. 5), passing the rings down to
the feet, and by the aid of the carrier push them well back into the womb and
hold them there. Meanwhile drag upon the ropes attached to the two other feet
so as to bring them into the passage (or, in case of the anterior extremity, on
the two foot ropes and the head one). The other feet must be pushed back into
the womb until the body of the calf is fully engaged in the passages. After
this they can no longer find an entrance, but must follow as the body
escapes.</p>

<h5>NEGLECTED AND AGGRAVATED CASES.</h5>

<p>In laying down the foregoing rules for giving assistance in critical cases
of calving it is not intimated that all cases and stages can be successfully
dealt with. Too often assistance is not sought for many hours or even days
after labor pains, and the escape of the waters intimate the danger of delay.
Not seldom the long delay has been filled up with unintelligent and injurious
attempts at rendering assistance, violent pulling when resistance is
insurmountable without change of position, injuries to the vagina and womb by
ill-considered but too forcibly executed attempts to change the position, the
repeated and long-continued contact with rough hands and rougher ropes and
hooks, the gashes with knives and lacerations with instruments in ignorant
hands, the infecting material introduced on filthy hands and instruments, and
the septic inflammations started in the now dry and tender passages and womb.
Not infrequently the death, putrefaction, and bloating of the calf in the womb
render the case extremely unpromising and make it impossible to apply
successfully many of the measures above recommended. The labor pains of the cow
may have practically ceased from exhaustion; the passages of the vagina may be
so dry, tender, friable, red, and swollen that it requires considerable effort
even to pass the oiled hand through them, and the extraction of the calf or any
portion of it through such a channel seems a hopeless task; the womb may be
equally dry, inflamed and swollen, so that its lining membrane or even its
entire thickness is easily torn; the fetal membranes have lost their natural,
unctuous and slippery character, and cling firmly to the dry walls of the womb,
to the dry skin of the calf, or to the hands of the operator; the dead and
putrefying calf may be so bloated with gases <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>that the womb has been
overdistended by its presence, and the two adhere so closely that the motion of
the one on the other is practically impossible. In other cases reckless
attempts to cut the calf in pieces have left raw surfaces with projecting bones
which dangerously scratch and tear the womb and passages.</p>

<p>In many cases the extreme resort must be had of cutting the fetus to pieces
(embryotomy), or the still more redoubtable one of CÃ¦sarean section (extraction
through the flank).</p>

<h5>DISSECTION OF THE UNBORN CALF (EMBRYOTOMY).</h5>

<p>In some cases the dissection of the calf is the only feasible means of
delivering it through the natural passages; and while it is especially
applicable to the dead calf, it is also on occasion called for in the case of
the living. As a rule, the living calf should be preserved, if possible, but if
this threatens to entail the death of the cow it is only in the case of
offspring of rare value that its preservation is to be preferred. To those
acquainted with the toil, fatigue, and discomfort of embryotomy, no discussion
is necessary so long as there is a prospect of success from the simple and
generally easier method of rectifying the faulty position of the calf. When the
correction of the position is manifestly impossible, however, when distortions
and monstrosities of the fetus successfully obstruct delivery, when the pelvic
passages are seriously contracted by fractures and bony growths, when the
passages are virtually almost closed by swelling, or when the calf is dead and
excessively swollen, no other resort may be available. In many cases of
distortion and displacement the dismemberment of the entire calf is
unnecessary, the removal of the offending member being all that is required. It
will be convenient, therefore, to describe the various suboperations one by one
and in the order in which they are usually demanded.</p>

<p><em>Amputation of the fore limb</em>.&mdash;In cutting off a fore limb it is the one
presenting that should be selected, since it is much more easily operated on,
and its complete removal from the side of the chest affords so much more space
for manipulation that it often makes it easy to bring the other missing limb or
the head into position. The first consideration is to skin the limb from the
fetlock up and leave the skin attached to the body. The reasons for this are:
(<em>a</em>) That the skin is the most resistant structure of the limb, and when it has
been removed the entire limb can be easily detached; (<em>b</em>) the tough skin left
from the amputated limb may be used as a cord in subsequent traction on the
body of the calf; (<em>c</em>) the dissection and separation of the limb are far more
safely accomplished under the protection of the enveloping skin than if the
operator's hands and instruments were in direct contact with the walls of the
passages or womb; (<em>d</em>) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>the dissection can be much more easily
effected while the skin is stretched by the left hand, so as to form a
comparatively firmer resistant point for the knife, than when it is attempted
to cut the soft, yielding, and elastic tissues which naturally offer little
solid resistance, but constantly recede before the cutting edge of the
instrument. The preservation of the skin is therefore a cardinal principle
in the amputation of all parts in which it is at all feasible.</p>

<p>The presenting foot is inclosed in a noose and drawn well out of the
passages. Then a circular incision through the skin is made around the limb
just above the fetlock. From this the skin is slit up on the inner side of the
limb to the breast. Then the projecting part of the limb is skinned up to the
vulva, traction being made on the foot by an assistant so as to expose as much
as possible. The embryotomy knife may now be taken (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl.
XXI</a>, fig. 2), and a small hole having been cut in the free end of the
detached portion of skin, that is seized by the left hand and extended while
its firm connections with the deeper structures are cut through. The looser
connections can be more quickly torn through with the closed fist or the tips
of the four fingers held firmly together in a line or with the spud, of which
there are several kinds. Much of the upper part of the limb can be skinned more
speedily without the knife, but that must be resorted to to cut across tough
bands whenever these interrupt the progress. The skinning should be carried
upward on the outer side of the shoulder blade to the spine or nearly so. Then
with the knife the muscles attaching the elbow and shoulder to the breastbone
are cut across, together with those on the inner side of the shoulder joint and
in front and behind it as far as these can be reached. Steady traction is now
made upon the foot, the remaining muscles attaching the shoulder blade to the
trunk are torn through with a cracking noise, and the whole limb, including the
shoulder blade and its investing muscles, comes away. If the shoulder blade is
left the bulk of the chest is not diminished, and nothing has been gained.
Before going further it is well to see whether the great additional space thus
secured in the passages will allow of the missing limb or head to be brought
into position. If not, the other presenting part, limb or head, is to be
amputated and extracted. For the limb the procedure is a repetition of that
just described.</p>

<p><em>Amputation of the head</em>.&mdash;The head is first seized and drawn well
forward, or even outside the vulva, by a rope with a running noose placed
around the lower jaw just behind the incisor teeth, by a sharp hook inserted in
the arch of the lower jaw behind the union of its two branches and back of the
incisor teeth, or by hooks inserted in the orbits, or, finally, in case the
whole head protrudes, by a halter. (<a href="#PLATE_XXI">Pl. XXI</a>, figs 4<em>a</em> and
4b.) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
In case the whole head protrudes, a circular incision through the skin
is made just back of the ear, and the cut edge being held firmly by the left
hand, the neck is skinned as far as it can be reached. Then the great
ligamentous cord above the spine is cut across at the farthest available point,
together with the muscles above and below the spine. Strong traction on the
head will then detach it at this point and bring it away, but should there
still be too much resistance the knife is inserted between the bodies of two
vertebrÃ¦ just behind one of the prominent points felt in the median line below,
and their connecting fibrous cartilage is cut through, after which
comparatively moderate pulling will bring it away. The detached neck and body
at once slip back into the womb, and if the fore limbs are now brought up and
pulled they are advanced so far upon the chest that the transverse diameter of
that is greatly diminished and delivery correspondingly facilitated.</p>

<p>If the head is still inclosed in the vagina two methods are available: (1)
The removal of the lower jaw and subsequent separation of the head from the
neck; (2) the skinning of the whole head and its separation from the neck.</p>

<p>To remove the lower jaw the skin is dissected away from it until the throat
is reached. Then the muscles of the cheeks and side of the jaw
(masseters) are cut through and those connecting the jaw with the neck. When
traction is made on the rope around the lower jaw it will usually come away
with little trouble. Should it resist, its posterior extremity on each side
(behind the grinding teeth) may be cut through with bone forceps or with a
guarded bone chisel. (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX</a>, fig. 8.) After the
removal of the lower jaw the way will be open to separate the head from the
neck, the knife being used to cut into the first or second joint from below, or
the bone forceps or chisel being employed to cut through the bones of the neck.
Then traction is made on the head by means of hooks in the orbits, and the
hand, armed with an embryotomy knife, is introduced to cut through the tense
resisting ligament, and muscles above the bones. The skin and the strong
ligamentous cord attached to the poll are the essential things to cut, as the
muscles can easily be torn across. Unless there are great difficulties in the
way it is well to skin the head from the eyes back, and on reaching the poll to
cut through the ligament and then bring the head away by pulling.</p>

<p>If it is decided to remove the entire head at once, it may be skinned from
the front of the eyes back to behind the lower jaw below and the poll above,
then cut through the muscles and ligaments around the first joint and pull the
head away, assisting, if need be, in the separation of the head by using the
knife on the ligament of the joint.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
</p>

<p>If the calf is a double-headed monster, the skinning of the head must be
carried backward until the point has been reached where both heads branch from
the single neck, and the separation must be made at that point. The muscles and
ligaments are first to be cut through; and if the part can not then be detached
by pulling, the bodies of the vertebrÃ¦ may be separated by passing the knife
through the joint. The second head may now be secured by a noose around the
lower jaw or hooks in the orbits and brought up into place, the body being
pushed back toward the other side by a repeller, so as to make room.</p>

<p>It should be added that, except in the case of a double-headed monster, or
in case of the head protruding or nearly so, and one or both fore limbs
presenting, it is rarely desirable to undertake amputation of the head. The
space desirable in the passages can usually be obtained by the much simpler and
easier procedure of removing one or both fore limbs.</p>

<p><em>Amputation of the hind limbs</em>.&mdash;This is sometimes demanded on the one
extended limb when the other can not be brought up and delivery can not be
effected; also in case of monsters having extra hind limbs; when the calf is
dead, putrid, and bloated with gas; and in some cases of breech presentation,
as described under that head.</p>

<p>When the limb is extended the guiding principles are as in the case of the
fore limbs. The skin is cut through circularly above the fetlock and slit up to
beneath the pelvic bones on the inner side of the thigh. It is then dissected
from the other parts as high as it has been slit on the inner side and to above
the prominence (<em>trochanter major</em>) on the upper end of the thigh bone on the
outer side of the joint. In this procedure the hands and spud can do much, but
owing to the firmer connections the knife will be more frequently required than
in the case of the fore limb. The muscles are now cut through all around the
hip joint, and strong traction is made by two or three men on the limb. If
there is still too much resistance, a knife is inserted into the joint on the
inner side and its round ligament cut through, after which extraction will be
comparatively easy. This accomplished, it will often be possible to extract the
fetus with the other leg turned forward into the womb. If the calf is bloated
with gas, it may be necessary to remove the other leg in the same way, and even
to cut open the chest and abdomen and remove their contents before extraction
can be effected. In the case of extra limbs it may be possible to bring them up
into the passages after the presenting hind limbs have been removed. If this is
not practicable, they may be detached by cutting them through at the hip joint,
as described under "Breech presentation," page 197.</p>

<p>Another method of removing the hind limb is, after having skinned it over
the quarter, to cut through the pelvic bones from <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>before backward, in the
median line below, by knife, saw, or long embryotome (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl.
XX</a>, fig. 1), and then disjoint the bones of the spine (sacrum) and the hip
bone (ilium) on that side with embryotome, knife, or saw, and then drag away
the entire limb, along with all the hip bones on that side. This has the
advantage of securing more room and thereby facilitating subsequent operations.
Both limbs may be removed in this way, but on the removal of the second the
operator is without any solid point to drag upon in bringing away the remainder
of the fetus.</p>

<p><em>Division across the middle of the body</em>.&mdash;In cases of extra size,
monstrosity, or distortion of one end of the body it may be requisite to cut
the body in two and return the half from the passages into womb, even after
one-half has been born. The presenting members are dragged upon forcibly by
assistants to bring as much of the body as possible outside. Then cut through
the skin around the body at some distance from the vulva, and with hand, knife,
and spud detach it from the trunk as far back into the passages as can be
reached. Next cut across the body at the point reached, beginning at the lower
part (breast, belly) and proceeding up toward the spine. This greatly favors
the separation of the backbone when reached, and further allows of its being
extended so that it can be divided higher up. When the backbone is reached, the
knife is passed between the two bones, the prominent ridges across their ends
acting as guides, and by dragging and twisting the one is easily detached from
the other. With an anterior presentation the separation should, if possible, be
made behind the last rib, while with a posterior presentation as many of the
ribs should be brought away as can be accomplished. Having removed one half of
the body, the remaining half is to be pushed back into the womb, the feet
sought and secured with nooses, and the second half removed in one piece if
possible; and if not, then after the removal of the extra limb or other cause
of obstruction.</p>

<p><em>Removal of the contents of chest or abdomen</em>.&mdash;If the body of the calf
sticks fast in the passages by reason of the mere dryness of its skin and of
the passages, the obstacle may be removed by injecting sweet oil past the fetus
into the womb through a rubber or other tube, and smearing the passages freely
with lard. When the obstruction depends on excess of size of the chest or
abdomen or thickening of the body from distorted spine, much advantage may be
derived from the removal of the contents of these great cavities of the trunk.
We have already seen how the haunches may be narrowed by cutting the bones
apart in the median line below and causing their free edges to overlap each
other. The abdomen can be cut open by the embryotomy knife or the long
embryotome in the median line, or at any point, and the contents pulled out
with the hand, the knife being used in any case when especial resistance is
encountered. If the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">
[Pg 207]</a></span>abdomen is so firmly impacted that it can not be dealt
within this way, one hind limb and the hip bone on the same side may be removed
as described under "Amputation of the hind limbs," page 205. This will allow
the introduction of the hand into the abdomen from behind, so as to pull out
the contents. By introducing an embryotomy knife in the palm of the hand and
cutting through the muscle of the diaphragm the interior of the chest can be
reached in the same way and the heart and lungs removed.</p>

<p>When, in dealing with an anterior presentation, it becomes necessary to
remove the contents of the chest, the usual course is to cut through the
connections of the ribs with the breastbone (the costal cartilages) close to
the breastbone on each side, and from the abdomen forward to the neck. Then cut
through the muscles connecting the front of the breastbone with the neck and
its hinder end with the belly, and pull out the entire breastbone. Having torn
out the heart and lungs with the hand, make the rib cartilages on the one side
overlap those on the other, so as to lessen the thickness of the chest, and
proceed to extract the body. If it seems needful to empty the abdomen as well,
it is easy to reach it by cutting through the diaphragm, which separates it
from the chest.</p>

<p><em>Delivery through the flank</em> (<em>C&aelig;sarean section</em>, or <em>laparotomy</em>).&mdash;This is
sometimes demanded, when the distortion and narrowing of the hip bones are such
as to forbid the passage of the calf, or when inflammation has practically
closed the natural passages and the progeny is more valuable and worthy of
being saved than the dam; also in cases in which the cow has been fatally
injured, or is ill beyond possibility of recovery and yet carries a living
calf. It is too often a last resort after long and fruitless efforts to deliver
by the natural channels, and in such cases the saving of the calf is all that
can be expected, the exhausted cow, already the subject of active inflammation
and too often also of putrid poisoning, is virtually beyond hope. The
hope of saving the dam is greatest if she is in good health and not fatigued,
in cases, for example, in which the operation is resorted to on account of
broken hip bones or abnormally narrow passages.</p>

<p>The stock owner will not attempt such a serious operation as this. Yet, if
the mother has just died or is to be immediately sacrificed, no one should
hesitate to resort to it in order to save the calf. If alive, it is important
to have the cow perfectly still. Her left fore leg being bent at the knee by
one person, another may seize the left horn and nose and turn the head to the
right until the nose rests on the spine just above the shoulder. The cow will
sink down gently on her left side without shock or struggle. One may now hold
the head firmly to the ground, while a second, carrying the end of the tail
from behind forward on the inside of the right thigh, pulls upon it so as to
keep the right hind limb well raised from the ground. If time presses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>she may
be operated on in this position, or if the cow is to be sacrificed a blow on
the head with an ax will produce quietude. Then the prompt cutting into the
abdomen and womb and the extraction of the calf requires no skill. If, however,
the cow is to be preserved, her two forefeet and the lower hind one should be
safely fastened together and the upper hind one drawn back. Two ounces chloral
hydrate, given by injection, should induce sleep in 20 minutes, and the
operation may proceed. In case the cow is to be preserved, wash the right flank
and apply a solution of 4 grains of corrosive sublimate in a pint of water.</p>

<p>Then, with an ordinary scalpel or knife, dipped in the above-mentioned
solution, make an incision from 2 inches below and in front of the outer angle
of the hip bone in a direction downward and slightly forward to a distance of
12 inches. Cut through the muscles, and more carefully through the transparent
lining membrane of the abdomen (peritoneum), letting the point of the knife lie
in the groove between the first two fingers of the left hand as they are slid
down inside the membrane and with their back to the intestines. An assistant,
whose hands, like those of the operator, have been dipped in the sublimate
solution, may press his hands on the wound behind the knife to prevent the
protrusion of the intestines. The operator now feels for and brings up to the
wound the gravid womb, allowing it to bulge well through the abdominal wound,
so as to keep back the bowels and prevent any escape of water into the abdomen.
This is seconded by two assistants, who press the lips of the wound against the
womb. Then an incision 12 inches long is made into the womb at its most
prominent point, deep enough to penetrate its walls, but not so as to cut into
the water bags. In cutting, carefully avoid the cotyledons, which may be felt
as hard masses inside. By pressure the water bags may be made to bulge out as
in natural parturition, and this projecting portion may be torn or cut so as to
let the liquid flow down outside of the belly. The operator now plunges his
hand into the womb, seizes the fore or hind limbs, and quickly extracts
the calf and gives it to an attendant to convey to a safe place. The womb may
be drawn out, but not until all the liquid has flowed out, and the fetal
membranes must be separated from the natural cotyledons, one by one, and the
membranes removed. The womb is now emptied with a sponge, which has been boiled
or squeezed out of a sublimate solution, and if any liquid has fallen into the
abdomen it may be removed in the same way. A few stitches are now placed in the
wound in the womb, using carbolized catgut. They need not be very close
together, as the wound will diminish greatly when the womb contracts. Should
the womb not contract at once it may have applied against it a sponge squeezed
out of a cold sublimate solution, or it may be drawn out of the abdominal wound
and exposed to the cold <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">
[Pg 209]</a></span>air until it contracts. Its contraction is necessary to
prevent bleeding from its enormous network of veins. When contracted, the womb
is returned into the abdomen and the abdominal wound sewed up. One set of
stitches, to be placed at intervals of 2 inches, is passed through the entire
thickness of skin and muscles and tied around two quills or little rollers
resting on the skin. (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 7.) These
should be of silver, and may be cut at one end and pulled out after the wound
has healed. The superficial stitches are put in every half inch and passed
through the skin only. They, too, may be of silver, or pins may be inserted
through the lips and a fine cord twisted round their ends like a figure 8.
(<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 9.) The points of the pins may be
snipped off with pliers. The edges may be still further held together by the
application of Venice turpentine, melted so as to become firmly adherent, and
covered with a layer of sterilized cotton wool. Then the whole should be
supported by a bandage fixed around the loins and abdomen.</p>

<div class="dop">
<p class="dop1"><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> XII.</span> Fetal calf within
its membranes (at mid term). The uterus is opened on the left side. In the
uterus the fetus is surrounded by several membranes which are known as the
amnion or inner layer, the allantois or central layer, and the chorion or outer
layer. The amnion is nearest the fetus and forms a closed sac around it filled
with a fluid known as liquor amnii, in which the fetus floats. The allantois
is composed of two layers, which form a closed sac in connection with the
urachus, or the tube which extends from the fetal bladder through the umbilical
cord. The one layer of the allantois is spread over the outer surface of the
amnion and the other over the inner surface of chorion. The allantois also
contains a fluid which is known as the allantoid liquid. The chorion is the
outer envelope or membrane of the fetus, completely inclosing the fetus with
its other membranes. On the outer surface of this membrane are found the fetal
placentulÃ¦, or cotyledons, which, through their attachment to the maternal
cotyledons, furnish the fetus with the means of sustaining life. The relation
of the fetal and maternal cotyledons to each other is illustrated on the
following Plate.</p>

<h4>FLOODING (BLEEDING FROM THE WOMB).</h4>

<p>Though not so common in the cow as in the human female, flooding is
sufficiently frequent to demand attention. It may depend on a too rapid calving
and a consequent failure of the womb to contract when the calf has been
removed. The pregnant womb is extraordinarily rich in blood vessels, especially
in large and tortuous veins, which become compressed and almost obliterated
under contraction, but remain overfilled and often bleed into the cavity of the
womb should no contraction take place. Cox records cases in which the labor
pains had detached and expelled the fetal membranes, while the calf, owing to
large size or wrong presentation, was detained in the womb, and the continued
dilatation of the womb in the absence of the fetal membranes led to a flow of
blood which accumulated in clots around the calf. Other causes are laceration
of the cotyledons of the womb, or from an antecedent inflammation of the
placenta, and the unnatural adhesion of the membranes to the womb, which bleeds
when the two are torn apart. Weakness of the womb from overdistention, as in
dropsy, twins, etc., is not without its influence. Finally, eversion of the
womb (casting the withers) is an occasional cause of flooding. The trouble is
only too evident when the blood flows from the external passages in drops or in
a fine stream. When it is retained in the cavity of the womb, however, it may
remain unsuspected until it has rendered the animal almost bloodless. The
symptoms in such case are paleness of the eyes, nose, mouth, and of the lips of
the vulva, a weak, rapid pulse, violent and perhaps loud beating of the heart
(palpitations), sunken, staring eyes, coldness of the skin, ears, horns, and
limbs, perspiration, weakness in standing, staggering gait, and, finally,
inability to rise, and death in convulsions. If these symptoms are seen, the
oiled hand should be introduced into the womb, which will be found open and
flaccid and containing large blood clots.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in the removal of the fetal membranes
and blood clots from the womb (which will not contract while they are present),
the dashing of cold water on the loins, right flank, and vulva, and if these
measures fail, the injection of cold water into the womb through a rubber tube
furnished with a funnel. In obsti<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>nate cases a good-sized
sponge soaked in tincture of muriate of iron should be introduced into the
womb and firmly squeezed, so as to bring the iron into contact with the
bleeding surface. This is at once an astringent and a coagulant for the
blood, besides stimulating the womb to contraction. In the absence of this
agent astringents (solution of copperas, alum, tannic acid, or acetate of
lead) may be thrown into the womb, and one-half-dram doses of acetate of
lead may be given by the mouth, or 1 ounce powdered ergot of rye may be
given in gruel. When nothing else is at hand, an injection of oil of
turpentine will sometimes promptly check the bleeding.</p>

<h4>EVERSION OF THE WOMB (CASTING THE WITHERS).</h4>

<p>Like flooding, this is the result of failure of the womb to contract after
calving. If that organ contracts naturally, the afterbirth is expelled, the
internal cavity of the womb is nearly closed, and the mouth of the organ
becomes so narrow that the hand can not be forced through, much less the whole
mass of the matrix. When, however, it fails to contract, the closed end of one
of the horns may fall into its open internal cavity, and under the compression
of the adjacent intestines, and the straining and contraction of the abdominal
walls, it is forced farther and farther, until the whole organ is turned
outside in, slides back through the vagina, and hangs from the vulva. The womb
can be instantly distinguished from the protruding vagina or bladder by the
presence, over its whole surface, of 50 to 100 mushroomlike bodies
(cotyledons), each 2 to 3 inches in diameter, and attached by a narrow neck.
(<a href="#PLATE_XXII">Pls.&nbsp;XXII</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a>.)
When fully everted, it is further recognizable by a large, undivided body hanging
from the vulva, and two horns or divisions which hang down toward the hocks.
In the imperfect eversions the body of the womb may be present with two depressions
leading into the two horns. In the cases of some standing the organ has become
inflamed and gorged with blood until it is as large as a bushel basket, its
surface has a dark-red, bloodlike hue, and tears and bleeds on the slightest
touch. Still later lacerations, raw sores, and even gangrene are shown in the mass.
At the moment of protrusion the general health is not altered, but soon the
inflammation and fever with the violent and continued straining induce exhaustion,
and the cow lies down, making no attempt to rise.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment varies somewhat, according to the degree of the
eversion. In partial eversion, with the womb protruding only slightly from the
vulva and the cow standing, let an assistant pinch the back to prevent
straining while the operator pushes his closed fist into the center of the mass
and carries it back through the vagina, assisting in returning the surrounding
parts by the other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a>
</span>hand. In more complete eversion, but with the womb as yet of its natural bulk
and consistency and the cow standing, straining being checked by pinching the back,
a sheet is held by two men so as to sustain the everted womb and raise it to the
level of the vulva. It is now sponged clean with cold water, the cold being
useful in driving out the blood and reducing the bulk, and finally it may be
sponged over with laudanum or with a weak solution of carbolic acid (1 dram to
1 quart water).</p>

<p>The closed fist may now be planted in the rounded end of the largest horn
and pushed on so as to turn it back within itself and carry it on through the
vagina, the other hand being used meanwhile to assist in the inversion and in
pushing the different masses in succession within the lips of the vulva. In
case of failure, resort should be had at once to a plan which I have
successfully followed for many years. Take a long linen or cotton bandage, 5 or
6 inches wide, and wind it around the protruding womb as tightly as it can be
drawn, beginning at the free end and gradually covering the entire mass up to
the vulva. By this means the greater part of the blood will be forced out of
the organ and its bulk greatly reduced, so that its reduction is much
facilitated. An additional advantage is found in the protection given to the
womb by its investing bandage while it is being pushed forward into the vagina
and abdomen. In manipulating the exposed womb there is always danger of
laceration, but when the organ is covered with a sheet it is next to impossible
to tear it. The subsequent manipulation is as in the other case, by pushing the
blind end forward within itself with the closed fist and carrying this on
through the vagina into the abdomen with the constant assistance of the other
hand. Often it will be found convenient to use the edge of the left hand to
push the outer part of the protruding mass inside the lips of the vulva, while
the right hand and arm are carrying the central portions forward through the
vagina. An intelligent assistant, pushing with the palms of both hands on the
outer portion of the mass, will also afford material assistance. As the womb is
turned within itself the wrapping bandage will gradually loosen, but once the
great mass has entered the passages it is easy to compel the rest to
follow, and the compression by the bandage is no longer so important. When the
womb is fully replaced the bandage is left in its interior in a series of loose
folds, and can be easily withdrawn. It is well to move the hand from side to
side to insure that the two horns of the womb are fully extended and on about
the same level before withdrawing the arm and applying a truss.</p>

<p>When the womb has been long everted and is gorged with blood, inflamed, and
friable there is often the additional disadvantage that the animal is unable or
unwilling to rise. When lying down the straining can not be controlled so
effectually, and, even in the absence <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"
id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>of straining, the compression of the
belly is so great as to prove a serious obstacle to reduction. The straining
may be checked by 2 or 3 ounces of laudanum or 2 ounces of chloral hydrate, or
by inhalation of chloroform to insensibility, and then by raising the hind
parts on straw bundles the gravitation of the abdominal organs forward may be
made to lessen the resistance. If not successful in this way, the cow may be
further turned on her back, and if return is still impossible, the hind limbs
may be tied together and drawn up to a beam overhead by the aid of a pulley. In
this position, in place of the pressure backward of the bowels proving a
hindrance, their gravitation forward proves a most material help to reduction.
In seeking to return the womb the sponging with ice-cold water, raising on a
sheet, and wrapping in a tight bandage should be resorted to. Another method
which is especially commendable in these inflamed conditions of the womb is to
bring a piece of linen sheet, 30 by 36 inches, under the womb, with its
anterior border close up to the vulva, then turn the posterior border upward
and forward over the organ, and cross the two ends over this and over each
other above. The ends of the sheet are steadily drawn, so as to tighten its
hold on the womb, which is thus held on the level of the vulva or above, and
cold water is constantly poured upon the mass. The reduction is further sought
by compression of the mass with the palms applied outside the sheet. Fifteen or
twenty minutes are usually sufficient to cause the return of the womb, provided
straining is prevented by pinching the back, or otherwise.</p>

<p>In old and aggravated cases, with the womb torn, bruised, or even
gangrenous, the only resort is to amputate the entire mass. This is done by
tying a strong, waxed cord around the protruding mass close to the vulva,
winding the cord around pieces of wood, so as to draw it as tightly as
possible, cutting off the organ below this ligature, tying a thread on any
artery that may still bleed, and returning the stump well into the vagina.</p>

<p>Retention of the returned womb is the next point, and is most easily
accomplished by a rope truss. Take two ropes, each about 18 feet long and an
inch in thickness. Double each rope at its middle, and lay the one above the
other at the bend, so as to form an ovoid of about 8 inches in its long
diameter. Twist each end of the one rope twice around the other, so that this
ovoid will remain when they are drawn tight.
(<a href="#PLATE_XXII">Pls.&nbsp;XXII</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a>.)
Tie a strap or rope around the back part of the neck and a surcingle around the body.
Place the rope truss on the animal so that the ovoid ring will surround the vulva, the
two ascending ropes on the right and left of the tail and the two descending
ones down inside the thighs on the right and left of the udder. These
descending ropes are carried forward on the sides of the body and tied to the
surcingle and to the neck collar. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218"
id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>The ascending ropes proceed forward on the
middle of the back, twisting over each other, and are tied to the surcingle and
collar. The upper and lower ropes are drawn so tightly that the rope ring is
made to press firmly all around the vulva without risk of displacement. This
should be worn for several days, until the womb shall have closed and all risk
of further eversion is at an end. Variations of this device are found in the
use of a narrow triangle of iron applied around the vulva and fixed by a
similar arrangement of ropes, surcingle, and collar (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl.
XXIII</a>, fig. 3), a common crupper similarly held around the vulva
(<a href="#PLATE_XXII">Pl. XXII</a>, fig. 1), stitches through the vulva, and wire
inserted through the skin on the two hips (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII</a>,
fig. 2), so that they will cross behind the vulva; also pessaries of
various kinds should be inserted into the vagina. None of these devices,
however, present any advantage over the simple and comparatively painless rope
truss described above. Such additional precautions as keeping the cow in a
stall higher behind than in front, and seeing that the diet is slightly
laxative and nonstimulating may be named. If straining is persistent, ounce
doses of laudanum may be used twice a day, and the same may be injected into
the vagina.</p>

<p>If the womb has been cut off, injections of a solution of a teaspoonful of
carbolic acid in a quart of water should be used daily, or more frequently,
until the discharge ceases.</p>

<h4>EVERSION OF THE BLADDER.</h4>

<p>A genuine eversion of the bladder is almost unknown in the cow, owing to the
extreme narrowness of its mouth. The protrusion of the bladder, however,
through a laceration sustained in calving, in the floor of the vagina and its
subsequent protrusion through the vulva, is sometimes met with. In this case
the protruding bladder contains urine; this can never be the case in a real
eversion, in which the inner surface of the bladder and the openings of the
ureters are both exposed outside the vulva. The presence of a bag containing
water, which is connected with the floor of the vagina, will serve to identify
this condition. If the position of the bladder in the vulva renders it
impracticable to pass a catheter to draw off the urine, pierce the organ with
the nozzle of a hypodermic syringe, or even a very small trocar and cannula,
and draw off the water, when it will be found an easy matter to return the
bladder to its place. The rent in the vagina can be stitched up, but as there
would be risk in any subsequent calving it is best to prepare the cow for the
butcher.</p>

<h4>RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER.</h4>

<p>This has been known to occur in protracted parturition when the fetus
finally passed while the bladder was full. The symptoms are <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>those of complete
suppression of urine and tenderness of the abdomen, with a steady accumulation
of liquid, and fluctuation on handling its lower part. If the hand is
introduced into the vagina it is felt to be hot and tender, and perhaps
slightly swollen along its floor. As a final test, if the lower, fluctuating
part of the abdomen is punctured with a hypodermic needle, a straw-colored
liquid of a urinous odor flows out. The condition has been considered as past
hope. The only chance for recovery would be in opening the abdomen, evacuating
the liquid, and stitching up the rent in the bladder, but at such a season, and
with inflammation already started, there would be little to hope for.</p>

<h4>RUPTURE OF THE WOMB.</h4>

<p>When the womb has been rendered friable by disease rupture may occur in the
course of the labor, but much more frequently it occurs from violence sustained
in attempting assistance in difficult parturition. It is also liable to occur
during eversion of the organ through efforts to replace it.</p>

<p>If it happens while the calf is still in the womb, it will usually bleed
freely and continuously until the fetus has been extracted, so that the womb
can contract on itself and expel its excess of blood. Another danger is that in
case of a large rent the calf may escape into the cavity of the abdomen and
parturition become impossible. Still another danger is that of the introduction
of septic germs and the setting up of a fatal inflammation of the lining
membrane of the belly (peritoneum). Still another is the escape of the small
intestine through the rent and on through the vagina and vulva, so as to
protrude externally and receive perhaps fatal injuries. In case of rupture
before calving, that act should be completed as rapidly and carefully as
possible, the fetal membranes removed, and the contraction of the womb sought
by dashing cold water on the loins, the right flank, or the vulva. If the calf
has escaped into the abdomen and can not be brought through the natural
channels, it may be permissible to fix the animal and extract it through the
side, as in the CÃ¦sarian section. If the laceration has happened during
eversion of the womb it is usually less redoubtable, because the womb contracts
more readily under the stimulus of the cold air so recently applied. In case
the abdomen has been laid open it is well to stitch up the rent, but if not, it
should be left to nature, and will often heal satisfactorily, the cow even
breeding successfully in after years.</p>

<p>Rupture of the floor of the vagina has been already referred to as allowing
the protrusion of the bladder. Laceration of the roof of this passage is also
met with as the result of deviations of the hind limbs and feet upward when the
calf lies on its back. In some such cases the opening passes clear into the
rectum, or the foot may even <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220"
id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>pass out through the anus, so that that opening
and the vulva are laid open into one.</p>

<p>Simple, superficial lacerations of the vaginal walls are not usually
serious, and heal readily unless septic inflammation sets in, in which case the
cow is liable to perish. They may be treated with soothing and antiseptic
injections, such as carbolic acid, 1 dram; water, 1 quart.</p>

<p>The more serious injuries depend on the complications. Rupture of the
anterior part of the canal, close to the mouth of the womb, may lead to the
introduction of infecting germs into the cavity of the abdomen, or protrusion
of the bowel through the rent and externally, either of which may prove fatal.
If both these conditions are escaped the wound may heal spontaneously. Rupture
into the bladder may lead to nothing worse than a constant dribbling of the
urine from the vulva. The cow should be fattened if she survives. Rupture into
the rectum will entail a constant escape of feces through the vulva, and, of
course, the same condition exists when the anus as well has been torn open. I
have successfully sewed up an opening of this kind in the mare, but in the case
of the cow it is probably better to prepare her for the butcher.</p>

<h4>CLOTS OF BLOOD IN THE WALLS OF THE VAGINA.</h4>

<p>During calving the vagina may be bruised so as to cause escape of blood
beneath the mucous membrane and its coagulation into large bulging clots.
The vulva may appear swollen, and on separating its lips the mucous membrane of
the vagina is seen to be raised into irregular rounded swellings of a dark-blue
or black color, and which pit on pressure of the finger. If the accumulation of
blood is not extensive it may be reabsorbed, but if abundant it may lead to
irritation and dangerous inflammation, and should be incised with a
lancet and the clots cleared out. The wounds may then be sponged twice a day
with a lotion made with 1 dram sulphate of zinc, 1 dram carbolic acid, and 1
quart water.</p>

<h4>RETAINED AFTERBIRTH.</h4>

<p>The cow, of all our domestic animals, is especially subject to this
accident. This may be partly accounted for by the firm connections established
through the fifty to one hundred cotyledons (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII</a>,
fig. 2) in which the fetal membranes dovetail with the follicles of the
womb. It is also most liable to occur after abortion, in which preparation has
not been made by fatty degeneration for the severence of these close
connections. In the occurrence of inflammation, causing the formation of new
tissue between the membranes and the womb, we find the occasion of unnaturally
firm adhesions which prevent the spontaneous detachment of the membranes.
Again, in low conditions <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">
[Pg 221]</a></span>of health and an imperfect power of contraction we
find a potent cause of retention, the general debility showing particularly in
the indisposition of the womb to contract, after calving, with sufficient energy to
expel the afterbirth. Hence we find the condition common with insufficient or
innutrious feed, and in years or localities in which the fodder has suffered
from weather. Ergoted, smutty, or musty fodder (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl. V</a>),
by causing abortion, is a frequent cause of retention. Old cows are more
subject than young ones, probably because of diminishing vigor. A temporary
retention is sometimes owing to a too rapid closure of the neck of the womb
after calving, causing strangulation and imprisonment of the membranes.
Conditions favoring this are the drinking of cold (iced) water, the eating of
cold feed (frosted roots), and (through sympathy between udder and womb) a too
prompt sucking by the calf or milking by the attendant.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of retention of the afterbirth are usually only
too evident, as the membranes hang from the vulva and rot away gradually,
causing the most offensive odor throughout the building. When retained
within the womb by closure of its mouth and similarly in cases in which the
protruded part has rotted off, the decomposition continues and the fetid
products escaping by the vulva appear in offensively smelling pools on the
floor and mat together the hairs near the root of the tail. The septic
materials retained in the womb cause inflammation of its lining membrane, and
this, together with the absorption into the blood of the products of
putrefaction, leads to ill health, emaciation, and drying up of the milk.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment varies according to the conditions. When the cow
is in low condition, or when retention is connected with drinking iced water or
eating frozen feed, hot drinks and hot mashes of wheat bran or other aliment
may be sufficient. If along with the above conditions, the bowels are somewhat
confined, an ounce of ground ginger, or half an ounce of black pepper, given
with a quart of sweet oil, or 1&frac12; pounds of Glauber's salt in at least 4
quarts of warm water, will often prove effectual. A bottle or two of flaxseed
tea, made by prolonged boiling, should also be given at frequent intervals.
Other stimulants, like rue, savin, laurel, and carminatives like anise, cumin,
and coriander, are preferred by some, but with very questionable reason, the
more so that the first three are not without danger. Ergot of rye, 1 ounce, or
its extract, 1 dram, may be resorted to to induce contraction of the womb. The
mechanical extraction of the membranes is, however, often called for; of this
there are several methods. The simplest is to hang a weight of 1 or 2 pounds to
the hanging portion, and allow this, by its constant dragging and by its
jerking effect when the cow moves, to pull the membranes from their attachments
and to stimulate the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">
[Pg 222]</a></span>womb to expulsive contractions. It frequently happens that
the afterbirth is only loosely adherent to the womb and its removal is effected
if but a slight amount of traction on it is exerted. This can be determined by
seizing the dependent part of the afterbirth between two sticks and rolling it
up on them until they lie against the vulva; then, by careful traction,
accompanied with slight jerking movements from side to side, the womb is
stimulated to expulsive contractions and the afterbirth is wound up more and
more on the sticks until finally its last connections with the womb are severed
and the remainder is expelled suddenly en masse. It is quite evident that
neglected cases with putrid membranes are poor subjects for this method, as the
afterbirth is liable to tear across, leaving a mass in the womb. During the
progress of the work any indication of tearing is the signal to stop and
proceed with greater caution or altogether abandon the attempt in this way.</p>

<p>The following method (that with the skilled hand) is the most promptly and
certainly successful. For this the operator had better dress as for a
parturition case. Again, the operation should be undertaken within twenty-four
hours after calving, since later the mouth of the womb may be so closed that it
becomes difficult to introduce the hand. The operator should smear his arms
with carbolized lard or vaseline to protect them against infection, and
particularly in delayed cases with putrid membranes. An assistant holds the
tail to one side, the operator seizes the hanging afterbirth with the left
hand, while he introduces the other along the right side of the vagina and
womb, letting the membranes slide through his palm until he reaches the first
cotyledon to which they remain adherent. In case no such connection is within
reach, with the left hand gentle traction is made on the membranes until the
deeper parts of the womb are brought within reach and the attachments to the
cotyledons can be reached. Then the soft projection of the membrane, which is
attached to the firm fungus-shaped cotyledon on the inner surface of the womb,
is seized by the little finger, and the other fingers and thumb are closed on
it so as to tear it out from its connections. To explain this, it is necessary
only to say that the projection from the membrane is covered by soft, conical
processes, which are received into cavities of a corresponding size on the
summit of the firm, mushroom-shaped cotyledon growing from the inner surface of
the womb. To draw upon the former, therefore, is to extract its soft, villous
processes from within the follicles or cavities of the other.
<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII</a>, fig. 2.) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223"
id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>If at times it is difficult to start
this extraction it may be necessary to get the finger nail inserted between the
two, and once started the finger may be pushed on, lifting all the villi, in
turn, out of their cavities. This process of separating the cotyledons must be
carefully conducted, one after another, until the last has been detached and
the afterbirth comes freely out of the passages. I have never found
any evil result from the removal of the whole mass at one operation, but Shaack
mentions the eversion of the womb as the possible result of the necessary
traction, and in cases in which those in the most distant part of the horn of
the womb can not be easily reached, he advises to attach a cord to the
membranes inside the vulva, letting it hang out behind, and to cut off the
membranes below the cord. Then, after two or three days' delay, he extracts the
remainder, now softened and easily detached. If carefully conducted, so as not
to tear the cotyledons of the womb, the operation is eminently successful; the
cow suffers little, and the straining roused by the manipulations soon
subsides. Keeping in a quiet, dark place, or driving a short distance at a
walking pace, will serve to quiet these. When the membranes have been
withdrawn, the hand, half closed, may be used to draw out of the womb the
offensive liquid that has collected. If the case is a neglected one, and the
discharge is very offensive, the womb must be injected as for leucorrhea.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINA (VAGINITIS).</h4>

<p>This may occur independently of inflammation of the womb, and usually as the
result of bruises, lacerations, or other injuries sustained during calving. It
will be shown by swelling of the lips of the vulva, which, together with their
lining membrane, become of a dark-red or leaden hue, and the mucous discharge
increases and becomes whitish or purulent, and it may be fetid. Slight cases
recover spontaneously, or under warm fomentations or mild astringent injections
(a teaspoonful of carbolic acid in a quart of water), but severe cases may go
on to the formation of large sores (ulcers), or considerable portions of the
mucous membrane may die and slough off. Baumeister records two cases of
diphtheritic vaginitis, the second case in a cow four weeks calved, contracted
from the first in a newly calved cow. Both proved fatal, with formation of
false membranes as far as the interior of the womb. In all severe cases the
antiseptic injections must be applied most assiduously. The carbolic acid may
be increased to one-half ounce to a quart, or chlorin water, or peroxid of
hydrogen solution may be injected at least three times a day. Hyposulphite of
soda, 1 ounce to a quart of water, is an excellent application, and the same
amount may be given by the mouth.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>LEUCORRHEA (MUCOPURULENT DISCHARGE FROM THE PASSAGES).</h4>

<p>This is from a continued or chronic inflammation of the womb, or the vagina,
or both. It usually results from injuries sustained in calving or from
irritation by putrid matters in connection with retained afterbirth, or from
the use of some object in the vagina (pessary) to prevent eversion of the womb.
Exposure to cold or other cause of disturbance of the health may affect an
organ so susceptible as this at the time of parturition so as to cause
inflammation.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The main symptom is the glairy, white discharge flowing
constantly or intermittently (when the cow lies down), soiling the tail and
matting its hairs and those of the vulva. When the lips of the vulva are drawn
apart the mucous membrane is seen to be red, with minute elevations, or pale
and smooth. The health may not suffer at first, but if the discharge continues
and is putrid the health fails, the milk shrinks, and flesh is lost. If the
womb is involved the hand introduced into the vagina may detect the mouth of
the womb slightly open and the liquid collected within its cavity. Examination
with the oiled hand in the rectum may detect the outline of the womb beneath,
somewhat enlarged, and fluctuating under the touch from contained fluid. In
some cases heat is more frequent or intense than natural, but the animal rarely
conceives when served, and, if she does, is liable to abort.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment with the injections advised for vaginitis is
successful in mild or recent cases. In obstinate ones stronger solutions may be
used after the womb has been washed out by a stream of tepid water until it
comes clear. A rubber tube is inserted into the womb, a funnel placed in its
raised end, and the water, and afterwards the solution, poured slowly through
it. If the neck of the womb is so close that the liquid can not escape, a
second tube may be inserted to drain it off. As injections may be used chlorid
of zinc, one-half dram to the quart of water, or sulphate of iron, 1 dram to
the quart. Three drams of sulphate of iron and one-half ounce ground ginger may
also be given in the feed daily.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB (METRITIS, INFLAMMATION OF WOMB AND ABDOMEN, OR
METROPERITONITIS).</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the womb may be slight or violent, simple or associated with
putrefaction of its liquid contents and general poisoning, or it may extend so
that the inflammation affects the lining membrane of the whole abdominal
cavity. In the last two cases the malady is a very grave one.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;The causes are largely the same as those causing inflammation
of the vagina. Greater importance must, however, be attached to
exposure to cold and wet and to septic infection.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms appear two or three days after calving, when
the cow may be seen to shiver, or the hair stands erect, especially along the
spine, and the horns, ears, and limbs are cold. The temperature in the rectum is
elevated by one or two degrees, the pulse is small, hard, and rapid (70 to
100), appetite is lost, rumination ceases, and the milk shrinks in quantity or
is entirely arrested, and the breathing is hurried. The hind limbs may shift
uneasily, the tail be twisted, the head and eyes turn to the right flank, and
the teeth are ground. With the flush of heat to the horns and other
extremities, there is redness of the eyes, nose, and mouth, and usually a dark
redness about the vulva. Pressure on the right flank gives manifest pain,
causing moaning or grunting, and the hind limbs are moved stiffly, extremely so
if the general lining of the abdomen is involved. In severe cases the cow lies
down and can not be made to rise. There is usually marked thirst, the bowels
are costive, and dung is passed with pain and effort. The hand inserted into
the vagina perceives the increased heat, and when the neck of the womb is
touched the cow winces. Examination through the rectum detects enlargement and
tenderness of the womb. The discharge from the vulva is at first watery, but
becomes thick, yellow, and finally red or brown, with a heavy or fetid odor.
Some cases recover speedily and may be almost well in two days; a large
proportion perish within two days of the attack, and some merge into the
chronic form, terminating in leucorrhea. In the worst cases there is local
septic infection and ulceration, or even gangrene of the parts, or there is
general septicemia, or the inflammation involving the veins of the womb causes
coagulation of the blood contained in them, and the washing out of the clots to
the right heart and lung leads to the blocking of the vessels in the latter and
complicating pneumonia. Inflammation of the womb and passages after calving are
always liable to these complications, and consequently to a fatal issue. Franck
records three instances of rapidly fatal metritis in cows, all of which had
been poisoned from an adjacent cow with retained and putrid afterbirth. Others
have had similar cases.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment in the slight cases of simple inflammation does
not differ much from that adopted for vaginitis, only care must be taken that
the astringent and antiseptic injections are made to penetrate into the womb.
After having washed out the womb a solution of chlorid of lime or permanganate
of potassium (one-half ounce to 1 quart of water), with an ounce each of
glycerin and laudanum to render it more soothing, will often answer every
purpose. It is usually desirable to open the bowels with 1&frac12; pounds of
Glauber's salt and 1 ounce of ginger in 4 quarts of warm water, and to apply
fomentation of warm water or even mustard poultices or turpentine to the right
flank.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the violent attacks with high temperature and much prostration, besides
the salts agents must be given to lower the temperature and counteract septic
poisoning. Salicylate of soda one-half ounce, or quinia 2 drams every four
hours will help in both ways, or ounce doses of hyposulphite of soda or dram
doses of carbolic acid may be given as often until six doses have been taken.
Tincture of aconite has often been used in 20-drop doses every six hours. If
the temperature rises to 106Â° or 107Â° F., it must be met by the direct
application of cold or iced water to the surface. The animal may be covered
with wet sheets and cold water poured on them frequently until the temperature
in the rectum is lowered to 102Â° F. In summer the cow may be allowed to dry
spontaneously, while in winter it should be rubbed dry and blanketed. Even in
the absence of high temperature much good may be obtained from the soothing
influence of a wet sheet covering the loins and flanks and well covered at all
points by a dry one. This may be followed next day by a free application of
mustard and oil of turpentine. When the animal shows extreme prostration,
carbonate of ammonia (1 ounce) may be given to tide over the danger, but such
cases usually perish.</p>

<p>In this disease, even more than in difficult and protracted parturition or
retained placenta, the attendants must carefully guard against the infection of
their hands and arms from the diseased parts. The hand and arm before entering
the passages should always be well smeared with lard impregnated with carbolic
acid.</p>

<h4>MILK FEVER (PARTURITION FEVER, PARTURIENT APOPLEXY, OR PARTURIENT
COLLAPSE).</h4>

<p>This disease is not only peculiar to the cow, but it may be said to be
virtually confined to the improved and plethoric cow. It further occurs only at
or near the time of calving. Indeed, these two factors, calving and plethora,
may be set apart as preeminently the causes of this disease. It is the disease
of cows that have been improved in the direction of early maturity, power of
rapid fattening, or a heavy yield of milk, and hence it is characteristic of
those having great appetites and extraordinary power of digestion. The heavy
milking breeds are especially its victims, as in them the demand for the daily
yield of 50 to 100 pounds of milk means even more than a daily increase of 2 to
3 pounds of body weight, mainly fat. The victims are not always fat when
attacked, but they are cows having enormous powers of digestion, and which have
been fed heavily at the time. Hence the stall-fed, city-dairy cow, and the farm
cow on a rich clover pasture in June or July are especially subject. The
condition of the blood globules in the suffering cow attests the extreme
richness and density of the blood, yet this peculiarity appears to have
entirely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
escaped the notice of veterinary writers. I have never examined the
blood of a victim of this disease without finding the red-blood globules
reduced to little more than one-half their usual size. Now, these globules
expand or contract according to the density of the liquid in which they float.
If we dilute the blood with water they will expand until they burst, whereas if
solids, such as salt or albumin, are added they shrink to a large extent. Their
small size, therefore, in parturition fever indicates the extreme richness of
the blood, or, in other words, plethora.</p>

<p>Confinement in the stall is an accessory cause, partly because stabled
cattle are highly fed, partly because the air is hotter and fouler, and partly
because there is no expenditure by exercise of the rich products of
digestion.</p>

<p>High temperature is conducive to the malady, though the extreme colds of
winter are no protection against it. Heat, however, conduces to fever, and
fever means lessened secretion, which means a plethoric state of the
circulation. The heats of summer are, however, often only a coincidence of the
real cause, the mature rich pastures, and especially the clover ones, being the
greater.</p>

<p>Electrical disturbances have an influence of a similar kind, disturbing the
functions of the body and favoring sudden variations in the circulation. A
succession of cases of the malady often accompany or precede a change of
weather from dry to wet, from a low to a high barometric pressure.</p>

<p>Costiveness, which is the usual concomitant of fever, may in a case of this
kind become an accessory cause, the retention in the blood of what should have
passed off by the bowels tending to increase the fullness of the blood vessels
and the density of the blood.</p>

<p>Mature age is a very strong accessory cause. The disease never occurs with
the first parturition, and rarely with the second. It appears with the third,
fourth, fifth, or sixth&mdash;after the growth of the cow has ceased and when
all her powers are devoted to the production of milk.</p>

<p>Calving is an essential condition, as the disturbance of the circulation
consequent on the contraction of the womb and the expulsion into the general
circulation of the enormous mass of blood hitherto circulating in the walls of
the womb fills to repletion the vessels of the rest of the body and very
greatly intensifies the already existing plethora. If this is not speedily
counterbalanced by a free secretion from the udder, kidneys, bowels, and other
excretory organs, the most dire results may ensue. Calving may thus be held to
be an exciting cause, and yet the labor and fatigue of the act are not active
factors. It is after the easy calving, when there has been little expenditure
of muscular or nervous energy and no loss of blood, that the malady is seen.
Difficult parturitions may be fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228"
id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>lowed by metritis, but they are rarely
connected with parturition fever.</p>

<p>All these factors coincide in intensifying the one condition of plethora and
point to that as a most essential cause of the affection. It is needless to
enter here into the much-debated question as to the mode in which the plethora
brings about the characteristic symptoms and results. As the results show
disorder or suspension of the nervous functions mainly, it may suffice to say
that this condition of the blood and blood vessels is incompatible with the
normal functional activity of the nerve centers. How much is due to congestion
of the brain and how much to bloodlessness may well be debated, yet in a closed
box like the cranium, in which the absolute contents can not be appreciably
increased or diminished, it is evident that, apart from dropsical effusion or
inflammatory exudation, there can be only a given amount of blood; therefore,
if one portion of the brain is congested, another must be proportionately
bloodless; and as congestion of the eyes and head generally and great heat of
the head are most prominent features of the disease, congestion of the brain
must be accepted. This, of course, implies a lack of blood in certain other
parts or blood vessels.</p>

<p>The latest developments of treatment indicate very clearly that the main
cause is the production of poisonous, metabolic products (leucomains and
toxins) by secreting cells of the follicles of the udder, acting on the
susceptible nerve centers of the plethoric, calving cow. Less fatal examples of
udder poisons are found in the first milk (colostrum), which is distinctly
irritant and purgative, and in the toxic qualities of the first milk drawn from
an animal which has been subjected to violent overexertion or excitement. Still
more conclusive as to the production of such poisons is the fact that the full
distention of the milk ducts and follicles, and the consequent driving of the
blood out of the udder and arrest of the formation of depraved products,
determines a speedy and complete recovery from the disease. This does not
exclude the other causes above named, nor the influence of a reflex nervous
derangement proceeding from the udder to the brain.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;It may be said that there are two extreme types of this
disease, with intervening grades. In both forms there is the characteristic
plethora and more or less sudden loss of voluntary movement and sensation,
indicating a sudden collapse of nervous power; in one, however, there is such
prominent evidence of congestion of head and brain that it may be called the
congestive form par excellence, without thereby intimating that the torpid form
is independent of congestion.</p>

<p>In the congestive form there is sudden dullness, languor, hanging back in
the stall, or drooping the head, uneasy movements of the hind <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>limbs or tail; if
the cow is moved, she steps unsteadily, or even staggers; she no longer notices
her calf or her feed; the eyes appear red and their pupils dilated; the
weakness increases and the cow lies down or falls and after that is unable to
rise. At this time the pulse is usually full, bounding, and the temperature
raised, though not invariably so, the head, horns, and ears being especially
hot and the veins of the head full, while the visible mucous membranes of nose
and eyes are deeply congested.</p>

<p>The cow may lie on her breastbone with her feet beneath the body and her
head turned sleepily round, with the nose resting on the right flank; or, if
worse, she may be stretched full on her side, with even the head extended,
though at times it is suddenly raised and again dashed back on the ground. At
such times the legs, fore and hind, struggle convulsively, evidently through
unconscious nervous spasm. By this time the unconsciousness is usually
complete; the eyes are glazed, their pupils widely dilated, and their lids are
not moved when the ball of the eye is touched with the finger. Pricking the
skin with a pin also fails to bring any wincing or other response. The pulse,
at first from 50 to 70 a minute, becomes weaker and more accelerated as the
disease advances. The breathing is quickened, becoming more and more so with
the violence of the symptoms, and at first associated with moaning (in
exceptional cases, bellowing), it may, before death, become slow, deep,
sighing, or rattling (stertorous). The temperature, at first usually raised,
tends to become lower as stupor and utter insensibility and coma supervene. The
bowels, which may have moved at the onset of the attack, become torpid or
completely paralyzed, and, unless in case of improvement, they are not likely
to operate again. Yet this is the result of paralysis and not of induration of
the feces, as often shown by the semiliquid, pultaceous condition of the
contents after death. The bladder, too, is paralyzed and fails to expel its
contents. A free action of either bladder or bowels, or of both, is always a
favorable symptom. The urine contains sugar, in quantity proportionate to the
severity of the attack.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases the torpor of the digestive organs results in gastric
disorder; the paunch becomes the seat of fermentation, producing gas, which
causes it to bloat like a drum. There are frequent eructations of gas and
liquid and solid feed, which, reaching the paralyzed throat, pass in part into
the windpipe and cause inflammations of the air passages and lungs.</p>

<p>In the torpid form of the disease there is much less indication of fever or
violence. There may be no special heat about the horns, ears, or forehead, nor
any marked redness or congestion of the eyes or nose, nor engorgement of the
veins of the head. The attack comes on more slowly, with apparent weakness of
the hind limbs, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
230]</a></span>dullness, drowsiness, suspension of rumination and appetite,
and a general indifference to surrounding objects. Soon the cow lies down, or
falls and is unable to rise, but for one or two days she may rest on the
breastbone and hold the head in the flank without showing any disorderly
movements. Meanwhile there is not only loss of muscular power and inability to
stand, but also considerable dullness of sensation, pricking the skin producing
no quick response, and even touching the edge of the eyelids causing no very
prompt winking. Unless she gets relief, however, the case develops all the
advanced symptoms of the more violent form, and the animal perishes.</p>

<p>In advanced and fatal cases of either form the insensibility becomes
complete; no irritation of skin or eye meets any response; the eye becomes
more dull and glassy; the head rests on the ground or other object; unless
prevented the cow lies stretched fully on her side; the pulse is small,
rapid, and finally imperceptible; the breathing is slow, deep, stertorous,
and the expirations accompanied with puffing is slow, the cheeks, and death comes
quietly or with accompanying struggles.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;For such fatal disease prevention is of far more
consequence than treatment. Among the most efficient preventives may be named a
spare diet (amounting to actual starvation in very plethoric, heavy-milking
cows) for a week before calving and at least four days after. A free access to
salt and water is most important, as the salt favors drinking and the water
serves to dilute the rich and dense blood. Iced water, however, is undesirable,
as a chill may favor the onset of fever. A dose of Epsom salt (1 to 2 pounds)
should be given 12 to 24 hours before calving is due, so that it may operate at
or just before that act. In case calving has occurred unexpectedly in the heavy
milker, no time should be lost in giving the purgative thereafter. A most
important precaution in the fleshy, plethoric cow, or in one that has been
attacked at a previous calving, is to avoid drawing any milk from the bag for
12 or 24 hours after calving. Breeders on the island of Jersey have found that
this alone has almost abolished the mortality from milk fever. If Epsom salt is
not at hand, saltpeter (1 ounce) should be used for several days. Daily
exercise is also of importance, and, excepting in midsummer, when the heat of
the sun may be injurious, the value of open air is unquestionable. Even in
summer an open shed or shady grove is incomparably better than a close, stuffy
stall. A rich pasture (clover especially), in May, June, or July, when at its
best, is to be carefully avoided. It is better to keep the cow indoors on dry
straw with plenty of salt and water than to have access to such pastures.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment of milk fever has been completely
revolutionized, with the result that a former mortality of 50 to 70 per cent
has been practically abolished. Formerly the most vigorous 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
treatment was practiced by bleeding, purging, the increase of peristalsis by
eserin or pilocarpin, enemas, cold in the head, counterirritants, aconite,
tartar emetic, sponging, wet-sheet packing, etc. The gross mortality,
however, was not materially reduced, and nearly all that were attacked
within the first two days after calving perished.</p>

<p>The first step in the modern treatment was made in 1897, when J. Schmidt
published his successful treatment by the injection of the teats and milk ducts
with a solution of iodid of potassium (1&frac12; drams to 1 quart of water). This
reduced the mortality to 17 per cent. Others followed this lead by the
injection of other antiseptics (lysol, creolin, creosol, chinosol, common salt,
etherized air, oxygen). These succeeded as well as the iodid solution. With the
injection of gases, however, a fuller distention of the udder was usually
secured, and virtually every case recovered. This suggested the full distention
of the udder with common atmospheric air filtered and sterilized, and this with
the most perfect success. With sterile air Schmidt-Kolding claimed 96.7 per
cent recoveries in 914 cases.</p>

<p>In America the full distention of the udder, whether with oxygen or filtered
air, has proved invariably successful in all kinds of cases, including the
violent ones that set in within a few hours after calving. In 1 or 2 hours
after the injection the cow has got up, had free passages from the bowels and
bladder, bright expression of countenance, and some return of appetite. In my
cases which had made no response for 8 hours to the iodid injection, the
injection of the udder to full repletion with the gas (oxygen or air) has had
immediately beneficial results. A similar full distention of the bag with a
common-salt solution (0.5 to 100), or even with well-boiled water, is equally
effective, but in these cases the weight of the liquid causes dragging upon the
udder and a measure of discomfort which is escaped under the treatment with
gas.</p>

<p>The value of each method depends on the fullness of distention of the udder
and the arrest in larger part of the circulation and chemical changes in its
tissues. This distention acts like magic, and seems hardly to admit of failure
in securing a successful outcome.</p>

<p>It can not, however, be recommended as absolutely devoid of dangers and
serious complications. To get the best results it should be applied only by one
who has been trained in the careful antiseptic methods of the bacteriological
laboratory. Some readers will recall the case of the injection of the udders of
show cows at Toronto to impose upon the judges. The cows treated in this way
had the udders infected and ruined, and several lost their lives. There is no
better culture medium for septic and other germs than the first milk
(colostrum) charged with albumin and retained in the warm udder. Already in the
hands of veterinarians even the Schmidt <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232"
id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>treatment has produced a small proportion of
cases of infective mammitis. How many more such cases will develop if this
treatment becomes a popular domestic resort, applied by the dairyman himself in
all sorts of surroundings and with little or no antiseptic precautions? Even
then, however, the losses will by no means approach the past mortality of
50 to 70 per cent, so that the economy will be immeasurable under even the
worst conditions. A fair test and judgment of this treatment, however,
can be obtained only when the administrator is trustworthy and painstaking,
well acquainted with bacteriological antisepsis and with the general and
special pathology of the bovine animal.</p>

<p>The necessary precautions may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Provide an elastic rubber ball and tubes furnished with valves to direct
the current of air, as in a common Davidson syringe.</p>

<p>(2) Fill the delivery tube for a short distance with cotton sterilized by
prolonged heating in a water bath.</p>

<p>(3) In the free end of the delivery tube fit a milking tube to be inserted
into the teat.</p>

<p>(4) Sterilize the entire apparatus by boiling for 30 minutes, and, without
touching the milking tube, wrap it in a towel that has been sterilized in a
water bath or in live steam and dried.</p>

<p>(5) Avoid drawing any milk from the teats; wash them and the udder
thoroughly with warm soapsuds; rinse off with well-boiled and cooled water, and
apply to the teats, and especially to their tips, a 5 per cent solution of
carbolic acid or lysol, taking care that the teats are not allowed to touch any
other body from the time they are cleansed until the teat tube is inserted. It
is well to rest the cleansed and disinfected udder on a sterilized pad of
cotton or a boiled towel.</p>

<p>(6) The injecting apparatus is unwrapped; the teat tube, seized by its
attached end and kept from contact with any other body, is inserted into the
teat, while an assistant working the rubber pump fills the quarter as full as
it will hold. The tube is now withdrawn and a broad tape is tied around the
free end of the teat to prevent escape of the air.</p>

<p>(7) The teat tube, which has been carefully preserved from possible contact
with other bodies, is dipped in the carbolic acid solution and inserted in a
second teat, and the second quarter is inflated, and so with the third and
fourth.</p>

<p>(8) The recumbent cow is kept resting on her breastbone, with the head
elevated, even if it should be necessary to pack around her with straw bundles
or to suspend the head by a halter. When lying on her side she is liable to
develop fatal bloating and to have belching of gas and liquids, which, passing
down the windpipe, cause fatal broncho-pneumonia.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
</p>

<p>(9) If in 2 hours the cow is not on her feet, if there is no brighter or
more intelligent expression, if she has passed no manure or urine, and if the
air has become absorbed, leaving the udder less tense, the injection of the bag
may be repeated, under the same scrupulous and rigid precautions as at first.
In all cases, but especially in severe ones, it is well to keep watch of the
patient, and to repeat the distention on the first indication of relapse.
Should there not be a free discharge of feces and urine after rising,
indicating a natural resumption of the nervous functions, the case should be
all the more carefully watched, so that the treatment may be repeated if
necessary.</p>

<p>Accessory treatment may still be used, but is rarely necessary. A dose of
purgative medicine (1&frac12; pounds of Epsom salt) in warm water may be given in
the early stages, while as yet there is no danger of its passing into the lungs
through paralysis of the throat. Eserin or pilocarpin (1&frac12; grains) may be
given under the skin to stimulate the movements of the bowels. Sponging the
skin, and especially the udder, with cool water, may be resorted to in hot
weather.</p>

<p>Bloating may demand puncture of the paunch, in the left flank, with a
cannula and trocar, the evacuation of the gas, and the introduction through
the tube of a tablespoonful of strong liquid ammonia in a quart of cold water or
other antiferment.</p>

<p>The economic value of the new treatment of milk fever is enormous. The
United States has more than 22,000,000 milk cows. If we could raise their
quality by preserving and breeding from the largest producers of both milk and
butterfat, in place of losing the best by milk fever, as in the past, and if we
could thus obtain an average increase of 2 quarts a day, the proceeds at 3
cents a quart would amount to $130,000,000 a year.</p>

<h4>PALSY AFTER CALVING (DROPPING AFTER CALVING).</h4>

<p>This consists in a more or less complete loss of control of the hind limbs
occurring after calving, and caused by low condition, weakness, and exposure to
cold or to injurious compression of the nerves of the hind limbs by a large
calf passing through the pelvis. Its symptoms do not differ from those of palsy
of the hind limbs, occurring at other times, and it may be treated in the same
way, except so far as bruises of the vagina may demand special smoothing
treatment.</p>

<h4>CONGESTION OF THE UDDER (GARGET).</h4>

<p>In heavy milkers, before and just after calving, it is the rule that the
mammary gland is enlarged, hot, tense, and tender, and that a slight exudation
or pasty swelling extends forward from the gland on the lower surface of the
abdomen. This physiological congestion is looked upon as a matter of course,
and disappears in two or three days when the secretion of milk has been fully
established. This <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">
[Pg 234]</a></span>breaking up of the bag may be greatly hastened by the sucking
of a hungry calf and the kneading it gives the udder with its nose, by stripping
the glands clean thrice daily, and by active rubbing at each milking with the
palm of the hand, with or without lard or, better, with camphorated ointment.</p>

<p>The congestion may be at times aggravated by standing in a draft of cold air
or by neglect to milk for an entire day or more (overstocking, hefting) with
the view of making a great show of udder for purposes of sale. In such cases
the surface of the bag pits on pressure, and the milk has a reddish tinge or
even streaks of blood, or it is partially or fully clotted and is drawn with
difficulty, mixed, it may be, with a yellowish serum (whey) which has separated
from the casein. This should be treated like the above, though it may sometimes
demand fomentations with warm water to ward off inflammation, and it may be a
week before the natural condition of the gland is restored.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER (SIMPLE MAMMITIS).</h4>

<p>Congestion may merge into active inflammation, or it may arise direct, in
connection with exposure to cold or wet, with standing in a cold draft, with
blows on the udder with clubs, stones, horns, or feet, with injury from a sharp
or cold stone, or the projecting edge of a board or end of a nail in the floor,
with sudden and extreme changes of weather, with overfeeding on rich albuminous
feed like cotton seed, beans, or peas, with indigestions, with sores on the
teats, or with insufficient stripping of the udder in milking. In the period of
full milk the organ is so susceptible that any serious disturbance of the
general health is liable to fall upon the udder.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms and mode of onset vary in different cases. When
following exposure there is usually a violent shivering fit, with cold horns,
ears, tail, and limbs, and general erection of the hair. This is succeeded by a
flush of heat (reaction) in which the horns, ears, and limbs become unnaturally
warm and the gland swells up and becomes firm and solid in one, two, three, or
all four quarters. There is hot dry muzzle, elevated temperature, full,
accelerated pulse, and excited breathing, impaired or suspended appetite and
rumination, with more or less costiveness, suppression of urine, and a lessened
yield of milk, which may be entirely suppressed in the affected quarter.</p>

<p>In other cases the shivering escapes notice, the general disorder of the
system is little marked or comes on late, and the first observed sign of
illness is the firm swelling, heat, and tenderness of the bag. As the
inflammation increases and extends, the hot, tender udder causes the animal to
straddle with its hind limbs, and, when walking, to halt on the limb on that
side. If the cow lies down it is on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>unaffected side. With the increase in
intensity and the extension of the inflammation the general fever manifests
itself more prominently. In some instances the connective tissue beneath the
skin and between the lobules of the gland is affected, then the swelling is
uniformly rounded and of nearly the same consistency, pitting everywhere on
pressure. In other cases it primarily attacks the secreting tissue of the
gland, then the swelling is more localized and appears as hard, nodular masses
in the interior of the gland. This last is the usual form of inflammation
occurring from infection entering by the teats.</p>

<p>In all cases, but especially in the last-named form, the milk is suppressed
and replaced by a watery fluid colored with blood (sometimes deeply) and
mingled with masses of clotted casein. Later it becomes white and purulent, and
in many cases of an offensive odor.</p>

<p>The course of the disease is sometimes so rapid and at others so slow that
no definite rule can be laid down. In two or three days, or from that to the
end of the week, the bag may soften, lose its heat and tenderness, and subside
into the healthy condition, even resuming the secretion of milk. The longer the
inflammatory hardness continues the greater the probability that its complete
restoration will not be effected. When a portion of the gland fails to be
restored in this way, and has its secretion arrested, it usually shrinks to a
smaller size. More commonly a greater quantity of the inflammatory product
remains in the gland and develops into a solid, fibrous mass, causing permanent
hardening (induration). In other cases, in place of the product of inflammation
developing into a fibrous mass, it softens and breaks down into white, creamy,
liquid pus (abscess). This abscess may make its way to the surface and escape
externally, or it may burst into a milk duct and discharge through the teat. It
may break into both and establish a channel for the escape of milk (fistula).
In the worst types of the disease gangrene may ensue, a quarter or half or even
the whole udder, losing its vitality, and sloughing off if the cow can bear up
against the depressing influence. These gangrenous cases are probably always
the result of infection and sometimes run a very rapidly fatal course. I
remember one to which I was called as soon as the owner noticed it, yet I found
one-quarter dark blue, cold, and showing a tendency to the formation of blebs
containing a bloody secretion. The cow, which had waded through a depth of
semiliquid manure to reach her stall, died within 24 hours.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment varies with the type and the stage of the
disease. If the case is seen in the shivering fit, every effort should be made
to cut it short, as the inflammation may be thereby greatly moderated, if not
checked. Copious drinks of warm water thrown in from horn or bottle; equally
copious warm injections; the application of heat in some form to the surface of
the body (by a rug wrung <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">
[Pg 236]</a></span>out of hot water; by hanging over the back and loins
bags loosely filled with bran, sand, salt, chaff, or other agent previously
heated in a stove; by the use of a flatiron or the warming of the surface by a
hot-air bath), or by active friction with straw wisps by two or more persons;
the administration of 1 ounce of ground ginger may serve to shorten the attack.
After half an hour's sweat the animal should be rubbed and covered with a dry
blanket.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, there is little or no fever, and only a slight
inflammation, rub well with camphorated ointment or a weak iodin ointment, and
milk three, four, or six times a day, rubbing the bag thoroughly each time.
Milking must be done with great gentleness, squeezing the teat in place of
pulling and stripping it, and if this causes too much pain, the teat tube
(<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 4) or the spring teat dilator (<a
href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 3) may be employed. Antiseptic
injections of the teats and udder are often useful, and iodoform in water has
been especially recommended. It may be replaced by one of the injections
advised for parturition fever, used with the same careful precautions.</p>

<p>In cases in which the fever has set in and the inflammation is more
advanced, a dose of laxative medicine is desirable (Epsom salt, 1 to 2 pounds;
ginger, 1 ounce), which may be followed, after the purging has ceased, by daily
doses of saltpeter, 1 ounce. Many rely on cooling and astringent applications
to the inflamed quarter (vinegar, sugar-of-lead lotion, cold water, ice, etc.),
but a safer and better resort is continued fomentation with warm water. A
bucket of warm water, replenished as it cools, may be set beneath the udder,
and two persons can raise a rug cut of this and hold it against the udder,
dipping it anew whenever the temperature is somewhat lowered. A sheet may be
passed around the body, with holes cut for the teats, soft rags packed between
it and the udder, and kept warm by pouring water on every 10 or 15 minutes, as
warm as the hand can bear. When this has been kept up for an hour or two, the
bag may be dried, well rubbed with soap, and left thus with a soapy coating. If
the pain is great, extract of belladonna may be applied along with the soap,
and a dry suspensory bandage with holes for the teats may be applied. Strong,
mercurial ointment is very useful in relieving pain and softening the bag. This
is especially valuable when the disease is protracted and induration threatens.
It may be mixed with an equal quantity of soap and half as much extract of
belladonna. In cases of threatened induration excellent results are sometimes
obtained from a weak-induction current of electricity sent through the gland
daily for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>If <em>abscess</em> threatens, it may be favored by fomentation and opened
as soon as fluctuation from finger to finger shows the formation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
matter at a point formerly hard. The wound may bleed freely, and there is a
risk of opening a milk duct, yet relief will be obtained; also a dressing
twice daily with a lotion of carbolic acid 1 part, water 20 parts, and
glycerin 1 part will suffice to keep the wound clean and healthy.</p>

<p><em>Gangrene</em> of the affected part is often fatal. It demands antiseptics
(chlorid of zinc, 1 dram to 1 quart water) applied frequently to the part, or,
if the case can not be attended, smear the affected quarter with Venice
turpentine, melted, or even wood tar. Antiseptic tonics (tincture of chlorid of
iron, 4 drams) may also be given four times daily in a quart of water.</p>

<h4>CONTAGIOUS MAMMITIS (CONTAGIOUS INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER).</h4>

<p>As stated in the last article, that form of inflammation of the udder which
attacks the gland ducts and follicles, causing deep-seated, hard, nodular
swellings, is often contagious. Franck has demonstrated this by injecting into
the milk ducts in different cows (milking and dry) the pus from the bags of
cows affected with mammitis, or the liquids of putrid flesh, or putrid blood,
and in every case he produced acute inflammation of the gland tissue within
twenty-four hours. He thinks that in ordinary conditions the septic germ gains
access by propagating itself through the milk, filling the milk canal and
oozing from the external orifice. He points to this as a reason why dry cows
escape the malady, though mingling freely with the sufferers, and why such dry
cows do not suffer from inflammation of the gland tissue when attacked with
foot-and-mouth disease. In this last case it is evident that it is not simply
the inoculation with the milker's hand that is lacking, for the skin of the bag
is attacked, but not its secreting, glandular parts. Now that in any case of
abscess we look for the cause in the chain forms of globular bacteria
(<em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>), in the cluster form of white, globular bacteria
(<em>Staphylococcus pyogenes albus</em>), and in the golden and citron-yellow forms of
clustered globular bacteria (<em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus
pyogenes citreus</em>), the formation of pus gives presumptive evidence of the
action of one or more of these germs. So in cases of mortification of the bag;
in the very occurrence there is fair circumstantial evidence of the presence of
erysipelas micrococcus or other germ which kills the local tissues. Again, in
tuberculosis affecting the bag (a not uncommon condition), the active local
cause is without doubt the tubercle bacillus.</p>

<p>It has been found that false membranes have formed in certain cases of
mammitis in the cow, and Klein, after inoculating the diphtheria of man on the
cow, found an ulcerous sore in the seat of inoculation and blisters on the
teats and udder, in which he found what <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238"
id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>he believed to be the bacillus of diphtheria.
The results are doubtful, even in the absence of false membranes. LÃ¶ffler, too,
in the diphtheria of calves, found that the germ was longer and more delicate
than that of man, and that its pathogenesis for rodents was less, guinea pigs
having only a nonfatal abscess. The presence of false membranes in one form
of mammitis in cows does not necessarily imply its communicability to man.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that scarlet fever has been transmitted from the cow to
man, and it can not be denied that in many cases the infection has been spread
by means of the milk. The facts, however, when brought out fully have shown
that in almost every case the milk had first come into contact with a person
suffering or recovering from scarlet fever, so that the milk was infected after
it left the cow. The alleged exceptional cases at Hendon and Dover, England,
are not conclusive. In the Hendon outbreak inoculations were made on calves
from the slight eruption on the cow's teats, and they had a slight eruption on
the lips and a form of inflammation of the kidneys, which Dr. Klein thought
resembled that of scarlatina. The cows that had brought the disease to the
Hendon dairies were traced back to Wiltshire, where cows were found suffering
from a similar malady, but no sign of scarlet fever resulted. In the Dover
outbreak the dairyman first denied any disease in his cows, and brought a
certificate of a veterinarian to prove that they were sound at the time of the
investigation; then later he confessed that the cows had had foot-and-mouth
disease some time before, and consequent eruption on the teats. So the question
remains whether the man who denied sickness in the cows to begin with, and
adduced professional evidence of it, did not later acknowledge the
foot-and-mouth disease as a blind to hide the real source of the trouble in
scarlatina in his own family or in the family of an employee.</p>

<p>In America Dr. Stickler said that he had produced scarlatina in children by
inoculation with imported virus of foot-and-mouth disease, but his contention
is negatived by the facts that with foot-and-mouth disease constantly present
in Europe scarlatina does not accompany it, and that in America, with
scarlatina constantly prevailing at some point, foot-and-mouth disease is
unknown locally except at long intervals and as the result of the importation
of infected animals or their products. Man is susceptible to foot-and-mouth
disease, but it never appears during the frequent epidemics of scarlatina.</p>

<p>Among other contagious forms of mammitis I may name one which I have
encountered in large dairies, starting as a sore and slight swelling at the
opening of the teat and extending up along the milk duct to the gland structure
in the bag, all of which become indurated, nodular, and painful. The milk is
entirely suppressed in that quarter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>of the bag, and from that it may extend to
the others as it does from cow to cow through the milker's hands.</p>

<p>Another form almost universally prevalent in this district of central New
York in 1889 broke out on the teats and udders as blisters strongly resembling
cowpox, but which were not propagated when inoculated on calves. It was only
exceptionally that this extended through the teat to the gland tissue, yet in
some instances the bag was lost from this cause. Scarlatina in man was very
prevalent at the time (many schools were closed in consequence), but no
definite connection seemed to exist between this and the cow disease, and on
different dairy farms there were families of young children that had never had
scarlet fever and who did not at that time contract it.</p>

<p>The most common cause of contagious mammitis in cattle is a spherical
bacterium in chain form (<em>Streptococcus</em>) (Moore, Ward). Yet it is clear that
contagious mammitis is not a single affection, but a group of diseases which
have this in common, that they attack the udder.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Prevention is to be especially sought in all such cases.
In purchasing new cows see that they come from a herd where the teats and udder
are sound. If a new cow with unknown antecedents comes from a public market,
let her be milked for a week by a person who does not milk any other cows. Keep
her in a separate stall from others, so that there may be no infection from
litter or flooring. Wash the udder with soap and water, and wet with a solution
of two teaspoonfuls of carbolic acid in a pint of water before letting the
regular milker of the other cows take her. If any cow in the herd shows the
indurated end of the teat or the inflammation and nodular tender
character of the gland, sequestrate her at once and give her a separate milker.
If another cow is to be put into the stall she occupied, first clean and scrape
it, and wet it with a strong solution of bluestone, 5 ounces in a gallon of
water. The milk may be drawn off with a teat tube, or spring teat dilator
(<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, figs. 3 and 4), and the milk ducts injected
frequently with a solution of peroxid of hydrogen or iodoform. I have had
little success in checking the upward progress of the disease through the teat
with carbolic acid or boric-acid solutions. Used on the outside of the other
teats, however, they may serve to prevent them from becoming infected. In the
absence of peroxid of hydrogen the affected teat may be injected with a
solution of 1 grain corrosive sublimate in a pint of water, and the same may be
used on the other teats, provided it is washed off every time before
milking.</p>

<p>As additional precautions, no cow with a retained afterbirth or unhealthy
discharge from the womb should be left with the other cows. Such cows doubtless
infect their own udders and those of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240"
id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>cows next them by lashing with the
soiled tail. If milkers handle retained afterbirth or vaginal discharge, or
unhealthy wounds, or assist in a difficult and protracted parturition, they
should wash the hands and arms thoroughly with soap and warm water and then rub
them with the corrosive-sublimate solution, or if not, at least with one of
carbolic acid. Clothes stained with such offensive products should be
thoroughly washed.</p>

<p>The general treatment of contagious mammitis does not differ from that of
the simple form, except that antiseptics should be given by the mouth as well
as applied locally (hyposulphite of soda, one-half ounce daily).</p>

<h4>COWPOX.</h4>

<p>This is another form of contagious inflammation of the udder which does not
spread readily from animal to animal except by the hands of the milker. It is
held to occur spontaneously in the cow, but this is altogether improbable, and
so-called spontaneous cases are rather to be looked on as instances in which
the germs have been preserved dry in the buildings or introduced in some
unknown manner. It is not uncommon in the horse, attacking the heels, the lips,
or some other inoculated part of the body, and is then easily transferred to
the cow, if the same man grooms and dresses the horse and milks the cow. It may
also appear in the cow by infection, more or less direct, from a person who has
been successfully vaccinated. Many believe that it is only a form of the
smallpox of man modified by passing through the system of cow or horse. It is,
however, unreasonable to suppose that this alleged modified smallpox could have
been transmitted from child to child (the most susceptible of the human race)
for 90 years, under all possible conditions, without once reverting to its
original type of smallpox. Chauveau's experiments on both cattle and horses
with the virus of smallpox and its inoculation back on the human subject go far
to show that in the climate of western Europe, at least, no such transformation
takes place. Smallpox remains smallpox and cowpox, cowpox. Again, smallpox is
communicable to a person who visits the patient in his room but avoids
touching him, while cowpox is never thus transferred through the air unless
deliberately diffused in the form of spray.</p>

<p>The disease in the cow is ushered in by a slight fever, which, however, is
usually overlooked, and the first sign is tenderness of the teats. Examined,
these may be redder and hotter than normal, and at the end of two days there
appear little nodules, like small peas, of a pale-red color, and increasing so
that by the seventh day they may measure three-fourths of an inch to 1 inch in
diameter. The yield of milk diminishes, and when heated it coagulates slightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
From the seventh to the tenth day the eruption forms into a blister, with
raised margins and a depression in the center, and from which the whole of the
liquid can not be drawn by a single puncture. The blister, in other words, is
chambered, and each chamber must be opened to evacuate the whole of the
contents. If the pock forms on a surface where there is thick hair it does not
rise as a blister, but oozes out a straw-colored fluid which concretes on the
hairs in an amber-colored mass. In one or two days after the pock is full it
becomes yellow from contained pus and then dries into a brownish-yellow scab,
which finally falls, leaving one or more distinct pits in the skin. Upon the
teats, however, this regular course is rarely seen; the vesicles are burst by
the hands of the milker as soon as liquid is formed, and as they continue to
suffer at each milking they form raw, angry sores, scabbing more or less at
intervals, but are slow to undergo healing.</p>

<p>The only treatment required is to heal the sores. As milking is the main
cause of their persistence, that must be done as gently as possible, or even
with the teat tube or dilator. (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, figs. 3 and
4.) It is essential to check the propagation of the germ, and for this
purpose the sore teats may be washed frequently with a solution of half an
ounce hyposulphite of soda in a pint of water. This will usually check the
inflammation and cut short the malady.</p>

<h4>SUPPRESSION OF MILK.</h4>

<p>The absence of milk in the udder may result from ill health, debility,
emaciation, chronic disease of the bag, wasting of the gland from previous
disease, or insufficient feed, but sometimes it will occur suddenly without any
appreciable cause. The treatment consists in removing the cause of the disease,
giving rich albuminoid feed made into warm mashes, and administering ounce
doses of aromatic carminatives, like anise seed, fennel seed, etc. Rubbing and
stripping the udder are useful; the application of oil of lavender or of
turpentine, or even a blister of Spanish flies, will sometimes succeed.</p>

<h4>BLOODY MILK.</h4>

<p>Blood may escape with the milk when the udder has been injured by
blows; also when it is congested or inflamed, when the circulation
through it has been suddenly increased by richer and more abundant feed, or
when the cow is under the excitement of heat. The milk frothing up and assuming
a pink tinge is often the first sign of red water, and it may result from
eating acrid or irritant plants, like the RanunculaceÃ¦, resinous plants, etc.
Deposits of tubercle or tumors in the udder, or induration of the gland, may be
efficient causes, the irritation caused by milking contributing to draw the
blood. Finally, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">
[Pg 242]</a></span>there may be a reddish tinge or sediment when madder or logwood
has been eaten.</p>

<p>In milk which becomes red after it is drawn it may be from the presence in
it of the <em>Bacillus prodigiosus</em>. This also grows on bread, and is the
explanation of the supposed miracle of the "bleeding host."</p>

<p>The treatment will vary with the cause. In congested glands give 1 pound of
Epsom salt, and daily thereafter one-half ounce saltpeter, with a dram of
chlorate of potassium; the bag should be bathed with hot or cold water, and
rubbed with camphorated lard. If the feed is too rich or abundant it must be
reduced. If from acrid plants, they must be removed from pasture or fodder.
Induration of the udder may be met by rubbing with a combination of iodin
ointment 1 part, soft soap 2 parts; mercurial ointment and soap also may be
used. Careful milking is imperative.</p>

<h4>BLUE MILK.</h4>

<p>Watery milk is blue, but the presence of a germ (<em>Bacillus cyanogenes</em>) causes
a distinct blue shade even in rich milk and cream. It may reach the milk after
it has been drawn, or it may find its way into the opening of the milk ducts
and enter the milk as it is drawn. In the latter case frequent milking and the
injection of a solution of 2 drams of hyposulphite of soda in a pint of water
into the teats will serve to destroy the germs.</p>

<h4>STRINGY MILK.</h4>

<p>This may be caused by fungi developing in the liquid, and that the spores
are present in the system of the cow may be safely inferred from the fact that
in a large herd two or three cows only will yield such milk at a time, and that
after a run of 10 days or a fortnight they will recover and others will be
attacked. I have found that such affected cows had the temperature raised one
or two degrees above the others. Like most other fungi this does not grow out
into filaments within the body of the cow, but in five or six hours after
milking the surface layers are found to be one dense network of filaments. If a
needle is dipped in this and lifted the liquid is drawn out into a long thread.
In one case which I investigated near Ithaca, N. Y., the contamination was
manifestly from a spring which oozed out of a bank of black-muck soil and stood
in pools mixed with the dejections of the animals. Inoculation of pure
milk with the water as it flowed out of this bank developed in it the fungus
and the stringy characters. By fencing the spring in and giving the affected
cows each 2 drams bisulphite of soda daily, the trouble was arrested promptly
and permanently.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>CHAPPED TEATS.</h4>

<p>These may be caused by anything which irritates them. The powerful sucking
of the calf; the sudden chilling of the teat in winter after the calf has just
let it go or after the completion of milking with a wet hand; contact with cold
water or stagnant, putrid water, or with filth or irritants when lying down;
slight congestions of the skin in connection with overstocking; indeed, any
source of local irritation may cause chapping. This may be slight or extend
into great, gaping sores and induce retention of milk or even mammitis.
Soothing applications of vaseline or a combination of equal parts of spermaceti
and oil of sweet almonds may be applied. If healing is tardy, add 10 grains
balsam of Peru to the ounce of ointment. If the irritation is very great, wash
first with a solution of 1 dram sugar of lead in 1 pint of water and then apply
benzoated zinc-oxid ointment.</p>

<h4>WARTS ON THE TEATS.</h4>

<p>These are often very troublesome, yet they may be greatly benefited or
entirely removed by smearing them thickly with pure olive oil after each
milking. If they persist they may be cut off with a pair of sharp scissors and
the sore touched with a stick of lunar caustic. They may now be oiled and the
caustic repeated as demanded to prevent their renewed growth.</p>

<p><em>Scabby teats</em> may be smeared with vaseline containing carbolic acid enough to
give it an odor.</p>

<h4>TEAT BLOCKED BY CONCRETION OF CASEIN.</h4>

<p>Under unhealthy conditions of the gland or milk ducts clots of casein form
which, pressed clear of most of their liquid and rolled into rounded masses,
may block the passage. They can be moved up and down by manipulation of the
teat, and if they can not be pressed out they may be extracted by using the
spring teat dilator (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 3), being held
surrounded by its three limbs. Before extraction is attempted an ounce of
almond oil, boiled, should be injected into the teat.</p>

<h4>TEAT BLOCKED BY CALCULUS.</h4>

<p>When the calcareous matter of the milk has been precipitated in the form of a
smooth, rounded stone, a rough, conglomerated concretion, or a fine, sandlike
dÃ©bris, it may cause obstruction and irritation. These bodies are felt to be
much harder than those formed by casein, and the milk usually contains gritty
particles. Extraction may be attempted, in the case of the finely divided
gritty matter, by simple milking or with the spring dilator (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 3)
in the case of the larger masses. Should this fail the teat may be laid open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
with the knife and sewed up again or closed with collodion, but such an operation
is best deferred until the cow is dry.</p>

<h4>TEAT BLOCKED BY A WARTY OR OTHER GROWTH INSIDE.</h4>

<p>In this case the obstruction may be near the orifice of the teat or farther
up, and the solid mass is not movable up and down with the same freedom as are
concretions and calculi. The movement is limited by the elasticity of the inner
membrane of the teat from which it grows, and is somewhat freer in certain
cases because the growth has become loose and hangs by a narrow neck. In the
case of the looser growths they may be snared by a fine, spring wire passed as
a loop through a fine tube (like a teat tube open at each end) and introduced
into the teat. When this can not be done, the only resort is to cut in and
excise it while the cow is dry.</p>

<h4>THICKENING OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE AND CLOSURE OF THE MILK DUCT.</h4>

<p>As a result of inflammation extending from without inward, a gradual
narrowing of the milk duct may occur from thickening and narrowing of its
lining membrane. This may be limited to a small area near the lower end, or it
may extend through the whole length of the teat. The stream of milk becomes
finer and finer until it finally ceases altogether, and a firm cord is felt
running through the teat. If the constriction is only at the outlet, the teat
may be seized and distended by pressing the milk down into it from above, and
an incision may be made with a sharp penknife in two directions at right angles
to each other and directly in the original opening. The knife should be first
cleansed in boiling water. The opening may be kept from closing by a dumb-bell
shaped bougie of gutta-percha (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 5) or
by the spring dilator. If the obstruction is more extended it may be perforated
by LÃ¼thi's perforating sound. (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 1A and
1B.) This is a steel wire with a ring at one end, and at the other is
screwed on to the wire a conical cap with sharp cutting edges at the base,
which scrapes away the thickened masses of cells as it is drawn back. This may
be passed again and again to enlarge the passages sufficiently, and then the
passage may be kept open by wearing a long, dumb-bell bougie, a thick piece of
carbolized catgut, or a spring dilator. If the passage can not be sufficiently
opened with the sound it may be incised by the hidden bistoury.
(<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 2.) This is a knife lying alongside a
flattened protector with smooth, rounded edges, but which can be projected
to any required distance by a lever on the handle. The incisions are made in
four directions, as deep as may be necessary, and the walls then can be held
apart by the spring dilator until they heal. In case the <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>constriction and thickening
of the canal extend the whole length of the teat, it is practically beyond
remedy, as the gland is usually involved so as to render it useless.</p>

<h4>CLOSURE OF THE MILK DUCT BY A MEMBRANE.</h4>

<p>In this form the duct of the teat is closed by the constriction of its
lining membrane at one point, usually without thickening. The closure usually
takes place while the cow is dry; otherwise its progress is gradual, and for a
time the milk may still be pressed through slowly. In such case, if left at
rest, the lower part of the teat fills up and the milk flows in a full stream
at the first pressure, but after this it will not fill up again without
sufficient time for it to filter through. This is to be cut open by the hidden
bistoury (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 2), which may be first
passed through the opening of the membrane, if such exists. If not it may be
bored through, or it may be pressed up against the membrane at one side of the
teat and opened toward the center, so as to cut its way through. Incisions
should be made in at least two opposite directions, and the edges then may be
held apart by wearing the spring dilator until healing has been completed.</p>

<p>In all cases of operations on the teats the instruments must be thoroughly
disinfected with hot water, or by dipping in carbolic acid and then in water
that has been boiled.</p>

<h4>OPENING IN THE SIDE OF THE TEAT (MILK FISTULA).</h4>

<p>This may occur from wounds penetrating the milk duct and failing to close,
or it may be congenital, and then very often it leads to a distinct milk duct
and an independent portion of the gland. In the first form it is necessary only
to dissect away the skin leading into the opening for some distance down, to
close the orifice with stitches, and to cover the whole with collodion. A teat
tube or spring dilator may be worn to drain the milk off and prevent distention
and reopening of the orifice. In case of an independent milk duct and gland one
of two courses may be selected&mdash;to open the one duct into the other by
incision and then close the offending opening, or to inject the superfluous
gland through its duct with a caustic solution, so as to destroy its secreting
power. In both cases it is desirable to wait until the cow goes dry.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_YOUNG_CALVES"
id="DISEASES_OF_YOUNG_CALVES"></a>DISEASES OF YOUNG CALVES.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">James Law, F. R. C. V. S.</span>,</h3>

<h5><em>Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University</em>.</h5>

<h4>SUSPENDED BREATHING.</h4>

<p>The moment the circulation through the navel string is stopped the blood of
the calf begins to become overcharged with carbon dioxid (CO<sub>2</sub>), and
unless breathing is speedily established death promptly follows. Fortunately
the desire to breathe, roused by the circulation of the venous blood and the
reflex action from the wet and chilling skin, usually starts the contractions
of the diaphragm at once and life is insured. Among the obstacles to breathing
may be named suffocation before or during birth from compression of the navel
cord and the arrest of its circulation; the detachment of the fetal membranes
from the womb before the calf is born; a too free communication between the two
auricles (foramen ovale) of the heart by which the nonaerated blood has mixed
too abundantly with the aerated and induced debility and profound weakness; a
condition of ill health and debility of the calf as a result of semistarvation,
overwork, or disease of the cow; fainting in the debilitated calf when calving
has been difficult and prolonged; the birth of the calf with its head enveloped
in the fetal membranes, so that it has been unable to breathe, and the presence
of tenacious phlegm in the mouth and nose, acting in the same manner.</p>

<p>Besides the importance of proper care and feeding of the cow as a preventive
measure, attention should be given at once to relieve the newborn calf of its
investing membrane and of any mucus that has collected in mouth or nostrils.
Wiping out the nose deeply with a finger or feather excites to sneezing,
hence to breathing. Blowing into the nose has a similar effect. Sucking the
nostril through a tube applied to it is even more effective. Slapping the chest
with the palm of the hand or with a towel dipped in cold water, compression and
relaxation alternately of the walls of the chest, may start the action, and
ammonia or even tobacco smoke blown into the nose may suffice. Every second is
precious, however, and if possible the lungs should be dilated by forcibly
introducing air from a bellows or from the human lungs. As the air is blown in
through bellows or a tube the upper end of the windpipe must be pressed back
against the gullet, as otherwise the air will go to the stomach. In a large
dairy a piece <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]
</a></span>of elastic tubing one-third of an inch in bore should be kept at
hand for sucking and blowing in such cases.</p>

<h4>BLEEDING FROM THE NAVEL.</h4>

<p>This may occur in two conditions&mdash;when the cord is cut off too close to
the navel and left untied and when it tears off at the navel. (<a href="#PLATE_XIV">Pl. XIV</a>.)
It may also bleed when torn across naturally, if it is sucked by the dam or
another calf. In an animal with little plasticity to its blood it will flow under
almost any circumstances. When any cord is left it is always safe to tie it,
and it is only when it is swollen and may possibly contain a loop of the bowel
that there is danger in doing so. By pressing upward any bulky contents such danger
is avoided. If torn or cut too close to be tied the bleeding may be checked by
applying alum, copperas, or for a fraction of a second the end of an iron rod
at a dull-red heat. If much blood has been lost it may be requisite to transfuse
several ounces of blood or of a weak, common-salt solution into the open,
umbilical vein.</p>

<h4>URINE DISCHARGED THROUGH THE NAVEL (PERSISTENT URACHUS).</h4>

<p>Before birth the urine passes from the bladder by a special tube through the
navel and navel string into the outer water bag (allantois). (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Pl. XII</a>.)
This closes at birth, and the tube shrinks into a fine cord up to the bladder.
It is only in the bull calf that it is liable to remain open, doubtless because
of the long, narrow channel through which the urine must otherwise escape. The
urethra, too, is sometimes abnormally narrow, or even closed, in the male.
If part of the cord remains, it should be tied and the whole allowed to wither
up naturally. If the cord has been removed and the tube (urachus) protrudes,
discharging the urine, that alone must be tied. If there is nothing pendent
the urachus must be seized, covered by the skin, and a curved needle being
passed through the skin and above the duct, it may be tied along with this skin.
A blister of Spanish flies, causing swelling of the skin, will often close the
orifice&mdash;so with the hot iron. If the urethra of the male is impervious
it can rarely be remedied.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE URACHUS (NAVEL URINE DUCT).</h4>

<p>This may originate in direct, mechanical injury to the navel in calving, or
shortly after, with or without the lodgment of irritant or septic matter on its
lacerated or cut end. The mere contact with healthy urine, hitherto harmless,
can now be looked on as becoming suddenly irritating. The affection is usually
marked by the presence of redness and swelling at the posterior part of the
navel and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]
</a></span>escape of urine and a few drops of whitish, serous pus from the
orifice of the urachus. In those cases in which urine is not discharged a
tender swelling, like a thick cord extending upward and backward from the navel
into the abdomen, may be identified. The navel enlargement may be considerable,
but it is solid, does not gurgle on handling, and can not be done away with by
pressing it back into the abdomen, as in a case of hernia.</p>

<p>In cases at first closed the pus may burst out later, coming from the back
part of the navel and the swelling extending backward. In other cases whitish
pus may pass with the urine by the ordinary channel, showing that it has opened
back into the bladder. In other cases the umbilical veins become involved, in
which case the swelling extends forward as well as backward. Thus the disease
may result in destructive disorders of the liver, lungs, and, above all, of the
joints.</p>

<p>The disease may usually be warded off or rendered simple and comparatively
harmless by applying antiseptics to the navel string at birth (carbolic acid 1
part, water and glycerin 5 parts each, or wood tar). Later, antiseptics may be
freely used (hyposulphite of soda 4 drams, water 1 quart) as an application to
the surface and as an injection into the urachus, or even into the bladder if
the two still communicate. If they no longer communicate, a stronger injection
may be used (tincture of chlorid of iron 60 drops, alcohol 1 ounce). Several
weeks will be required for complete recovery.</p>

<h4>ABSCESS OF THE NAVEL.</h4>

<p>As the result of irritation at calving or by the withered cord, or by
licking with the rough tongue of the cow, inflammation may attack the loose
connective tissue of the navel to the exclusion of the urachus and veins, and
go on to the formation of matter. In this case a firm swelling appears as large
as the fist, which softens in the center and may finally burst and discharge.
The opening, however, is usually small and may close prematurely, so that
abscess after abscess is formed. It is distinguished from hernia by the fact
that it can not be returned into the abdomen, and from inflammations of the
veins and urachus by the absence of swellings forward and backward along the
lines of these canals.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in an early opening of the abscess by a free incision and
the injection twice a day of an astringent antiseptic (chlorid of zinc one-half
dram, water 1 pint).</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE NAVEL VEINS (UMBILICAL PHLEBITIS).</h4>

<p>In this affection of the navel the inflammation may start directly from
mechanical injury, as in either of the two forms just described, but on this
are inoculated infective microbes, derived from a retained and putrefying
afterbirth, an abortion, a metritis, a fetid discharge <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>from the womb, an
unhealthy open sore, a case of erysipelas, from overcrowding, from filthy floor
or bedding, or from an offensive accumulation of manure, solid or liquid. As
the microbes vary in different cases, given outbreaks will differ materially in
their nature. One is erysipelatoid; another purulent infection with the
tendency to secondary abscesses in the joints, liver, lungs, etc.; another is
from a septic germ and is associated with fetid discharge from the navel and
general putrid blood poisoning. In estimating the causes of the disease we must
not omit debility of the calf when the mother has been underfed or badly housed
or when either she or the fetus has been diseased.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms vary. With the chain-form germs (streptococci)
the navel becomes intensely red, with a very firm, painful swelling, ending
abruptly at the edges in sound skin and extending forward along the umbilical
veins. The secondary diseases are circumscribed, black engorgements
(infarctions) or abscesses of the liver, lungs, kidneys, bowels, or other
internal organs, and sometimes disease of the joints.</p>

<p>With the ordinary pus-producing germs (<em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em> and
<em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>) the local inflammation in the navel causes a hot,
painful swelling, which rapidly advances to the formation of matter (pus), and
the raw, exposed surface, at first bright red, becomes dark red or black, soft,
friable, and pultaceous. If the pus is white, creamy, and comparatively
inoffensive in odor, the secondary formations in internal organs and joints are
mainly of the same purulent character (secondary abscesses).</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the discharge is very offensive and the pus more
serous, watery, or bloody, there is reason to suspect the presence of some of
the septic bacteria, and the results on the general system are a high fever and
softening of the liver and spleen and no tendency to abscesses of the internal
organs. Diarrhea is a common symptom, and death ensues early, the blood after
death being found unclotted.</p>

<p>Complicated cases are common, and in all alike the umbilical veins usually
remain open and can be explored by a probe passed at first upward and then
forward toward the liver.</p>

<p>Prevention is sought by applying a lotion of carbolic acid or iodin solution
to the navel string at birth, or it may be smeared with common wood tar, which
is at once antiseptic and a protective covering against germs. In the absence
of either a strong decoction of oak bark may be used.</p>

<p><em>Local treatment</em> consists in the application of antiseptic to the surface and
their injection into the vein. As a lotion carbolic acid, 1 ounce in a quart of
strong decoction of oak bark, should be used, or salicylic acid or salol may be
sprinkled on the surface. The interior <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251"
id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>of the vein should be swabbed out with a
probe wrapped around with cotton wool and dipped in boracic salicylic acid.</p>

<p>If complications have extended to the liver or other internal organs, or the
joints, other treatment will be demanded. In acute cases of general infection
an early fatal result is to be expected.</p>

<h4>PYEMIC AND SEPTICEMIC INFLAMMATION OF JOINTS IN CALVES (JOINT ILL).</h4>

<p>This occurs in young calves within the first month after birth. It persists
in the joints when once attacked, and is usually connected with disease of the
navel. Rheumatism, on the other hand, rarely occurs in a calf under a month
old. It tends to shift from joint to joint, and is independent of any navel
disease. Again, it affects the fibrous structures of the joints, and rarely
results in the formation of white matter, while the affection before named
attacks the structures outside as well as inside the joints and, above all, the
ends of the bones, and tends to the destruction and crumbling of their tissue,
and even to the formation of open sores, through which the fragile bones are
exposed. The microbes from the unhealthy and infected wound in the navel pass
into the system through the veins, or lymphatics, and form colonies and local
inflammations and abscesses in and around the joints.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are the swelling of one or more joints, which
are very hot and tender. The calf is stiff and lame, lies down constantly, and
does not care to suck. There is very high fever, accelerated breathing and
pulse, and there is swelling and purulent discharge (often fetid) from the
navel. There may be added symptoms of disease of the liver, lungs, heart, or
bowels, on which we need not here delay. The important point is to determine
the condition of the navel in all such cases of diseased and swollen joints
beginning in the first month of life, and in all cases of general stiffness,
for besides the diseases of the internal organs there may be abscesses formed
among the muscles of the trunk, though the joints appear sound. Cases of this
kind, if they do not speedily die, tend to become emaciated and perish later in
a state of weakness and exhaustion.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Prevention must begin with the purity of the buildings and
the navel, as noted in the last article.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is in the main antiseptic. The slighter forms may
be painted daily with tincture of iodin, or an ointment of biniodid of mercury
(1 dram) and lard (2 ounces) may be rubbed on the affected joints daily until
they are blistered. In case of swellings containing matter, this may be drawn
through the nozzle of a hypodermic syringe and the following solution injected:
Compound tincture of iodin, 1 dram; distilled (or boiled) water, 2 ounces.
Inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
nally the calf may take 5 grains quinin twice daily and 15 grains
hyposulphite of soda, or 20 grains salicylate of soda three times a day.</p>

<h4>UMBILICAL HERNIA (BREACH AT THE NAVEL).</h4>

<p>This may exist at birth from imperfect closure of the muscles around the
opening; it may even extend backward for a distance, from the two sides failing
to come together. Apart from this, the trouble rarely appears after the calf
has been some time on solid feed, as the paunch then extends down to the right
immediately over the navel, and thus forms an internal pad, preventing the
protrusion of intestine.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of umbilical hernia are a soft swelling at the
navel, with contents that usually gurgle on handling, and can be entirely
returned into the abdomen by pressure. The diseases of the navel hitherto
considered have no gurgling contents and can not be completely returned into
the abdomen. The only exception in the case of the hernia is when the walls of
the sac have become greatly thickened. These will, of course, remain as a
swelling after the bowel has been returned; and when the protruding bowel has
contracted permanent adhesion to the sac, it is impossible to return it fully
without first severing that connection.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is not always necessary. A small hernia, like an
egg, in a new-born calf, usually recovers of itself as the animal changes its
diet to solid feed and has the paunch fully developed as an internal pad.</p>

<p>In other cases apply a leather pad 8 inches square attached around the body
by two elastic bands connected with its four corners, and an elastic band
passing from its front border to a collar encircling the neck, and two other
elastic bands from the neck collar along the two sides of the body to the two
bands passing up over the back. (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig.
6.)</p>

<p>For small hernias nitric acid may be used to destroy the skin and cause such
swelling as to close the orifice before the skin is separated. For a mass like
a large goose egg one-half ounce of the acid may be rubbed in for three
minutes. No more must be applied for 15 days. For large masses this
is inapplicable, and with too much loss of skin the orifice may fail to close
and the bowels may escape.</p>

<p>The application of a clamp like those used in castration is a most effective
method, but great care must be taken to see that all the contents of the sac
are returned so that none may be inclosed in the clamp.(<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 7.)
</p>

<p>Another most effective resort is to make a saturated solution of common
salt, filter and boil it, and when cool inject under the skin (not into the
sac) on each side of the hernia a dram of the fluid. A ban<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>dage may then be put around
the body. In 10 hours an enormous swelling will have taken place, pressing back
the bowel into the abdomen. When this subsides the wound will have closed.</p>

<h4>DROPSY OF THE NAVEL.</h4>

<p>A sac formed at the navel, by contained liquid accumulated by reason of
sucking by other calves, is unsightly and sometimes injurious. After making
sure that it is simply a dropsical collection it may be deeply punctured at
various points with a large-sized lancet or knife, fomented with hot water, and
then daily treated with a strong decoction of white-oak bark.</p>

<h4>BLUE DISEASE (CYANOSIS).</h4>

<p>This appearing in the calf at birth is due to the orifice between the two
auricles of the heart (foramen ovale) remaining too open, allowing the
nonaerated (venous) blood to mix with the aerated (arterial) blood, and it is
beyond the reach of treatment. It is recognized by the blueness of the eyes,
nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes, the coldness of the surface, and the
extreme sensitiveness to cold.</p>

<h4>CONSTIPATION.</h4>

<p>At birth the bowels of the calf contain the meconium, a tenacious, gluey,
brownish-yellow material largely derived from the liver, which must be expelled
before they can start their functions normally. The first milk of the cow
(colostrum, beestings), rich in albumin and salts, is nature's laxative to
expel this now offensive material and should never be withheld from the calf.
If, for lack of this, from the dry feeding of the cow, or from any other cause,
the calf is costive, straining violently without passage, lying down and rising
as in colic, and failing in appetite, no time should be lost in giving relief
by an ounce dose of castor oil, assisting its action by injections of soapsuds
or oil. Whatever meconium is within reach of the finger should be carefully
removed. It is also important to give the cow a sloppy, laxative diet.</p>

<h4>INDIGESTION.</h4>

<p>This may occur from many different causes, as costiveness; a too liberal
supply of milk; milk too rich; the furnishing of the milk of a cow long after
calving to a very young calf; allowing a calf to suck the first milk of a cow
that has been hunted, driven by road, shipped by rail, or otherwise violently
excited; allowing the calf too long time between meals, so that impelled by
hunger it quickly overloads and clogs the stomach; feeding from the pail milk
that has been held over in unwashed (unscalded) buckets, so that it is
fermented and spoiled; feeding the milk of cows kept on unwholesome feed;
keeping the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]
</a></span> calves in cold, damp, dark, filthy, or bad-smelling pens; feeding
the calves on artificial mixtures containing too much starchy matter; or
overfeeding the calves on artificial feed that may be appropriate enough in
smaller quantity. The licking of hair from themselves or others and its
formation into balls in the stomach will cause obstinate indigestion in the
calf.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are dullness, indisposition to move,
uneasiness, eructations of gas from the stomach, sour breath, entire loss of
appetite, lying down and rising as if in pain, fullness of the abdomen, which
gives out a drumlike sound when tapped with the fingers.</p>

<p>The costiveness may be marked at first, but soon it gives place to diarrhea,
by which the offensive matters may be carried off and health restored. In other
cases it becomes aggravated, merges into inflammation of the bowels, fever sets
in, and the calf gradually sinks.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Prevention consists in avoiding the causes enumerated
above or any others that may be detected.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in first clearing away the irritant
present in the bowels. For this purpose 1 or 2 ounces of castor oil with 20
drops of laudanum may be given, and if the sour eructations are marked a
tablespoonful of limewater or one-fourth ounce calcined magnesia may be given
and repeated two or three times a day. If the disorder continues after the
removal of the irritant, a large tablespoonful of rennet, or 30 grains of
pepsin, may be given at each meal along with a teaspoonful of tincture of
gentian. Any return of constipation must be treated by injections of warm water
and soap, while the persistence of diarrhea must be met as advised under the
discussion following this. In case of the formation of loose hair balls
inclosing milk undergoing putrid fermentation, temporary benefit may be
obtained by giving a tablespoonful of vegetable charcoal three or four times a
day, but the only real remedy is to cut the paunch open and extract them. At
this early age they may be found in the third or even the fourth stomach; in
the adult they are confined to the first two and are comparatively harmless.</p>

<h4>DIARRHEA (SCOURING) IN CALVES (SIMPLE AND CONTAGIOUS).</h4>

<p>As stated in the last article, scouring is a common result of indigestion,
and at first may be nothing more than an attempt of nature to relieve the
stomach and bowels of offensive and irritating contents. As the indigestion
persists, however, the fermentations going on in the undigested masses become
steadily more complex and active, and what was at first the mere result of
irritation or suspended digestion comes to be a genuine contagious disease, in
which the organized ferments (bacteria) propagate the affection from animal to
animal and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]
</a></span>from herd to herd. More than once I have seen such epizootic
diarrhea start on the headwaters of a creek and, traveling along that stream,
follow the watershed and attack the herds supplied with water from the
contaminated channel. In the same way the disease, once started in a cow
stable, is liable to persist for years, or until the building has been
thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. It may be carried into a healthy stable by
the introduction of a cow brought from an infected stable when she is closely
approaching calving. Another method of its introduction is by the purchase of a
calf from a herd where the infection exists.</p>

<p>In enumerating the other causes of this disease we may refer to those noted
above as inducing indigestion. As a primary consideration any condition which
lowers the vitality or vigor of the calf must be accorded a prominent place
among factors which, apart from contagion, contribute to start the disease de
novo. Other things being equal, the strong, vigorous races are the least
predisposed to the malady, and in this respect the compact form, the healthy
coat, the clear eye, and the bold, active carriage are desirable. Even the
color of the hair is not unimportant, as in the same herd I have found a far
greater number of victims among the light colors (light yellow, light brown)
than among those of a darker tint. This constitutional predisposition to
indigestion and diarrhea is sometimes fostered by too close breeding, without
taking due account of the maintenance of a robust constitution; hence animals
that are very much inbred need to be especially observed and cared for unless
their inherent vigor has been thoroughly attested.</p>

<p>The surroundings of the calf are powerful influences. Calves kept indoors
suffer to a greater extent than those running in the open air and having the
invigorating influences of sunshine, pure air, and exercise; close, crowded,
filthy, bad-smelling buildings are especially causative of the complaint. The
presence in the air of carbon dioxid, the product of breathing, and of the
fetid, gaseous products of decomposing dung and urine diminish by about
one-fourth of their volume the life-giving oxygen and in the same ratio hinder
the aeration of the blood and the maintenance of vigorous health. Worse than
this, such fetid gases are usually direct poisons to the animal breathing them;
for example, sulphureted hydrogen (hydrogen sulphid 2 SH<sub>2</sub>) and
various alkaloids (ptomaines) and toxins (neutral poisonous principles)
produced in the filth fermentations. These lower the general health and
stamina, impair digestion, and by leading to the accumulation in stomach
and bowels of undigested materials they lay the foundation for offensive
fermentations within these organs and consequent irritation, poisoning, and
diarrhea. They further weaken the system so that it can no longer resist and
overcome the trouble.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The condition of the nursing cow and her milk is another potent cause of
trouble. The feed of the cow is important. The influence of this is shown in
the following tables:</p>

<p>In these examples the deterioration of the milk in casein on the less
nutritious winter feeding is very marked, although the relative quantity of
butter remains almost unchanged. In the case of the goat the result is even
more striking, the beet diet giving a very large decrease of both casein and
butter and an increase of milk sugar.</p>

<p>The second table following, condensed from the Iowa Agricultural Experiment
Station Bulletin, gives the results in butter and total solids when the same
cows were fed on different rations in succession. Each cow was fed a daily
ration of 12 pounds corn fodder and 4 pounds clover hay, besides the test diet
of (1) 12&frac14; pounds corn-and-cob meal, and (2) 10 pounds sugar meal&mdash;a
product of the glocuse manufacture. This special feed was given seven days
before the commencement of each test period to obviate the effects of
transition. The analyses of the special rations are given below:</p>

<p>Here we see in every instance a marked relative increase of the butter, and
to a less extent of the other milk solids whenever the sugar meal&mdash;rich in
fat and albuminoids&mdash;was furnished. The opposite theory having been
largely taught, it becomes needful thus to sustain the old and well-founded
belief of the dairymen.</p>

<p>Not only does the richness of the milk vary with the nature of the food, but
it varies also according to the time of the day when it is drawn, the morning
milk giving 7&frac12; per cent of cream and the evening milk 9&frac12; per cent
(Hassall). Boedecker found that the morning milk had 10 per cent of solids,
while the evening milk had 13 per cent. Again, the milk first drawn at any
milking is always poorer than the last drawn. The first may have only one-half,
or in extreme cases one-fourth, the cream of the last. Once more, when the cow
is in heat the milk becomes richer in solids (casein and butter), and contains
granular and white blood cells like the colostrum, and often disagrees with the
young animal living on it. Now, while these various modifications in the amount
of solid matters may prove harmless to a strong and vigorous calf, they can
easily be the occasion of intestinal disorder in a weaker one, or in one with
health already somewhat impaired by sickness, exposure, or unwholesome
buildings. The casein of the cow's milk coagulates in one solid mass, and is
much less easily penetrated by the digesting fluids than the fine, flaky
coagula of woman's or mare's milk. An excess of casein, therefore, thrown on an
already overtaxed stomach can all the more readily induce disorder. So it is
with butter fat. While a most important element in nutrition, it may be present
in the stomach in such quantity as to interfere with the action of the gastric
juice on the casein, and with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg
258]</a></span>the interruption of the natural stomach digestion the fats
themselves undergo decomposition with the production of offensive and
irritating fatty acids.</p>

<p>The milk of the very young cow is usually more watery than that of the
mature animal, and that of the old cow has a greater liability to become acid.
It varies much with the breed, the Channel Island cattle being notorious for
the relatively large quantity of cream, while the Holsteins, Ayrshires, and
Shorthorns are remarkable rather for the quantity of casein. The milk of cows
fed on potatoes and grass is very poor and watery; that from cows fed on
cabbage or Swedish turnips has a disagreeable taste and odor (from the former
an offensive liquid has been distilled).</p>

<p>Cows fed on overkept, fermented, and soured rations have acid milk, which
readily turns and coagulates. Thus old, long-kept brewer's grains, swill, the
refuse of glucose factories, and ensilage which has been put up too green all
act in this way. The same may come from disease in the cow's udder, or any
general disease of the cow with attendant fever, and in all such cases the
tendency is to rapid change and unwholesomeness. If the milk is drawn and fed
from a pail, there is the added danger of all sorts of poisonous ferments
getting into it and multiplying; it may be from the imperfect cleansing and
scalding of the pail; from rinsing the pails with water that is impure; from
the entrance of bacterial ferments floating in the filthy atmosphere of the
stable, or from the entrance of the volatile chemical products of
fermentation.</p>

<p>In addition to the dangers coming through the milk, the calf suffers in its
digestive powers from any temporary illness, and among others from the
excitement attendant on the cutting of teeth, and impaired digestion means
fermentations in the undigested masses and the excessive production of
poisonous ptomaines and toxins.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the starting or predisposing cause of this malady, when once
established it is liable to perpetuate itself by contagion and to prove a
veritable plague in a herd or a district.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of a diarrhea may appear so promptly after
birth as to lead to the idea that the cause already existed in the body of the
calf, and it usually shows itself before the end of the second week. It may be
preceded by constipation, as in retained meconium, or by fetid eructations and
colicky pains, as in acute indigestion. The tail is stained by the liquid
dejections, which are at first simply soft and mixed with mucus with a sour
odor, accompanied with a peculiar and characteristic fetor (suggesting rotten
cheese), which continually grows worse. The quantity of water and mucus
steadily increases, the normal predominance of fatty matters becoming modified
by the presence of considerable undigested casein, which is not present in the
normal feces, and in acute cases death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259"
id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> may result in one or two days from the
combined drain on the system and the poisoning by the absorbed products of the
decomposition in the stomach and bowels. When the case is prolonged the
passages, at first 5 or 6 a day, increase to 15 or 20, and pass with more and
more straining, so that they are projected from the animal in a liquid stream.
The color of the feces, at first yellow, becomes a lighter grayish yellow or a
dirty white (hence the name white scour), and the fetor becomes intolerable.</p>

<p>At first the calf retains its appetite, but as the severity of the disease
increases the animal shows less and less disposition to suck, and has lost all
vivacity, lying dull and listless, and, when raised, walking weakly and
unsteadily. Flesh is lost rapidly, the hair stands erect, the skin gets dry and
scurfy, the nose is dry and hot, or this condition alternates with a moist and
cool one. By this time the mouth and skin, as well as the breath and dung,
exhale the peculiar, penetrating, sour, offensive odor, and the poor calf has
become an object of disgust to all that approach it. At first, and unless
inflammation of the stomach and bowels supervenes (and unless the affection has
started in indigestion and colic), the belly is not bloated or painful on
pressure, symptoms of acute colicky pains are absent, and the bowels do not
rumble; neither are bubbles of gas mingled with the feces. The irritant
products of the intestinal fermentations may, however, irritate and excoriate
the skin around the anus, which becomes red, raw, and broken out in sores for
some distance. Similarly the rectum, exposed by reason of the relaxed condition
of the anus, or temporarily in straining to pass the liquid dejection, is of a
more or less deep red, and it may be ulcerated. Fever, with rapid pulse and
increased breathing and temperature, usually comes on with the very fetid
character of the feces and is more pronounced as the bowels become inflamed,
the abdomen sore to the touch and tucked up, and the feces more watery and even
mixed with blood.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;The prevention of these cases is the prevention of
constipation and indigestion, with all their varied causes as above
enumerated, the selection of a strong, vigorous stock, and, above all,
the combating of contagion, especially in the separation of the sick from the
healthy, and in the thorough purification and disinfection of the buildings.
The cleansing and sweetening of all drains, the removal of dung heaps, and
the washing and scraping of floors and walls, followed by a liberal application of
chlorid of lime (bleaching powder), 4 ounces to the gallon, are indicated.
Great care must be exercised in the feeding of the cow to have sound and
wholesome feed and water, so apportioned as to make the milk neither too rich
nor too poor, and to her health, so that the calf may be saved from the evil
consequences of poisonous principles that may be produced <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>in the body of the
cow. The calves should be carefully kept apart from all calving cows and their
discharges. Similarly each calf must have special attention to see that its
nurse gives milk which agrees with it, and that this is furnished at suitable
times. If allowed to suck, it should either be left with the cow or be fed
three times a day. If it becomes hungry twice a day, it is more liable to
overload and derange the stomach, and if left too long hungry it is tempted to
take in unsuitable and unwholesome feed, for which its stomach is as yet
unprepared. So, if fed from the pail, it is safer to do so three times daily
than twice. There should be the utmost cleanliness of feeding dishes, and the
feeder must be ever on the alert to prevent the strong and hungry from drinking
the milk of the weaker in addition to their own. In case the cow nurse has been
subjected to any great excitement by reason of travel, hunting, or carrying,
the first milk she yields thereafter should be used for some other purpose and
only the second allowed to the calf. Indeed, one and all of the conditions
indicated above as causes should be judiciously guarded against.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment varies according to the nature and stage of the
disease. When the disease is not widespread, but isolated cases only occur, it
may be assumed to be a simple diarrhea and is easily dealt with. The first
object is to remove the irritant matter from stomach and bowels, and for this 1
or 2 ounces of castor oil may be given, according to the size of the calf.
Reduce the milk by one-half or two-thirds. If the stools smell particularly
sour, the milk may be replaced by 1 ounce calcined magnesia, and in any case a
tablespoonful or two of limewater must be given with each meal. Great harm is
often done by giving opium and astringents at the outset. These serve merely to
bind up the bowels and retain the irritant source of the trouble; literally,
"to shut up the wolf in the sheep-fold." When the offending agents have been
expelled in this way, carminatives and demulcent agents may be given&mdash;1
dram of anise water, 1 dram nitrate of bismuth, and 1 dram of gum arabic, three
times a day. Under such course the consistency of the stools should increase
until in a day or two they become natural.</p>

<p>If, however, the outbreak is more general and evidently the result of
contagion, the first consideration is to remove all sources of such
contamination. Test the milk of the cow with blue litmus paper; if it reddens,
reject the milk until by sound, dry feeding, with perhaps a course of
hyposulphite of soda and gentian root, the milk is made alkaline. The castor
oil or magnesia will be demanded to clear away the (now infecting) irritants,
but they should be combined with antiseptics, and, while the limewater and the
carminative mixture may still be used, a most valuable addition will be found
in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a>
</span>following: Calomel, 10 grains; prepared chalk, 1 ounce; creosote, 1
teaspoonful; mix, divide into 10 parts, and give one four times a day. Or the
following may be given four times a day: One dram Dover's powder, 6 grains
powdered ipecacuanha; mix, divide into 10 equal parts. Injections of solutions
of gum arabic are often useful, and if the anus is red and excoriated, one-half
dram of copperas may be added to each pint of the gummy solution. All the milk
given must be boiled, and if that does not agree, eggs made into an emulsion
with barley water may be substituted. As the feces lose their watery character
and become more consistent, tincture of gentian in doses of 2 teaspoonfuls may
be given three or four times a day. Counter-irritants, such as mustard,
ammonia, or oil of turpentine, may be rubbed on the abdomen when it becomes
tender to the touch.</p>

<h4>ACUTE CONTAGIOUS SCOURING IN THE NEWBORN.</h4>

<p>The most violent and deadly form of diarrhea in the newborn calf deserves a
special mention. This may appear immediately after birth, and shows itself
almost invariably within the first or second day. The most intense symptoms of
white scour are complicated by great dullness, weakness, and prostration,
sunken eyes, retracted belly, short, hurried breathing, and very low
temperature, the calf lying on its side, with the head resting on the ground,
lethargic and unconscious or regardless of all around it. The bowel discharges
are profuse, yellowish white, and very offensive. As a rule death ensues within
24 to 36 hours.</p>

<p>A marked characteristic of this form of illness is that it attacks almost
every calf born in the herd, or in the building, rather, and if the calf
escapes an attack in the first two or three days of its life it usually
survives. Those that recover from an attack, however, are liable one or two
weeks later to suffer from an infective inflammation of the lungs. The
infection clings to a stable for years, in many cases rendering it impossible
to preserve and raise the calves. It has frequently coincided with abortions
and failures to conceive in the same herd, so that it has been thought that the
same infective germ produces one type of abortion. On the other hand, the
removal of the calving cow from the herd to calve in a separate building,
hitherto unused and therefore uninfected, usually effects the escape and
survival of the offspring.</p>

<p>The disease has been traced by Nocard and LigniÃ¨res to a small bacillus
having the general characters of those that produce hemorrhagic septicemia,
which is usually combined with a variety of others, but is in some cases alone
and in pure culture, especially in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262"
id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>the joints. The theory of LigniÃ¨res is that
this bacillus is the primary offender, and that once introduced it so depresses
the vital powers of the system and tissue cells that the healthy resistance to
other bacteria is impaired or suspended, and hence the general and deadly
invasion of the latter.</p>

<p>Inoculations with this bacillus killed guinea pigs or rabbits in 6 to 18
hours, and calves in 30 hours, with symptoms and lesions of hemorrhagic
septicemia, including profuse fetid diarrhea.</p>

<p>The predominance of the early and deadly lesions in the alimentary tract
would seem to imply infection through the feed, and the promptitude of the
attack after birth, together with the frequent coincidence of contagious
abortion in the herd, suggest the presence of the germ in the cow; yet the
escape of the calf when the cow calves in a fresh building is equally
suggestive of the infection through germs laid up in the building. This
conclusion is further sustained by the observation that the bacillus evidently
enters by the raw, unhealed navel, that it is diffused in the blood, and that a
very careful preservation of the navel against infection gives immunity from
attack.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;The disease is so certainly and speedily fatal that it is
hopeless to expect recovery, and therefore prevention is the rational
resort.</p>

<p>When a herd is small, the removal of the dam to a clean, unused stable a few
days before calving and her retention there for a week usually succeeds. It is
in the large herd that the disease is mainly to be dreaded, however, and in
this it is impossible to furnish new and pure stables for each successive group
of two or three calving cows. The thorough disinfection of the general stable
ought to succeed, yet I have seen the cleanest and purest stable repeatedly
disinfected with corrosive sublimate without stopping the malady. It would
appear as if the germ lodged on the surface or in the bowels of the cow and
tided the infection over the period of stable disinfection. Though insufficient
of themselves, the supply of separate calving boxes and the frequent thorough
cleaning and disinfection of both these and the stables should not be
neglected. The most important measure, however, is the disinfection of the
navel.</p>

<p>The cow should be furnished with abundance of dry, clean bedding, sprinkled
with a solution of carbolic acid. As soon as calving sets in the tail and hips
and anus and vulva should be sponged with a carbolic-acid solution (one-half
ounce to the quart), and the vagina injected with a weaker solution (2 drams to
the quart). Fresh carbolized bedding should be constantly supplied, so that the
calf may be dropped on that and not on soaked litter nor manure. The navel
string should be at once tied with a cord that has been taken from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
strong solution of carbolic acid. The stump of the cord and the adjacent skin should
then be washed with the following solution: Iodin, one-half dram; iodid of
potassium, one-half dram; water, 1 quart. When dry it may be covered with a
coating of collodion or tar, each containing 1 per cent of iodin.</p>

<p>Whenever a calf shows any sign of scouring it should be instantly removed to
another pen and building, and the vacated one should be thoroughly cleaned and
disinfected. Different attendants should take care of the sound calves and the
infected ones, and all utensils, litter, etc., kept scrupulously apart.</p>

<p>After one week the healthy calves may usually be safely herded together, or
they may be safely placed in the cow stable.</p>

<h4>OTHER AILMENTS OF THE CALF.</h4>

<p>Among these may be named several congenital imperfections, such as
imperforate anus, vulva, or prepuce, which are to be recognized by the
inability to pass dung or urine, in spite of straining, and the formation of
swellings in the anus, vulva, or sheath. Each must be carefully incised with
the knife, taking care not to injure the muscles which circumscribe the
respective openings; also tongue-tie, in which the thin, flaccid, mucous
membrane passing from the median line of the lower surface of the tongue binds
the latter too closely to the floor of the mouth and renders the tongue unfit
for gathering in the food in after life. This must be cut with knife or
scissors, so as to give the tongue a reasonable degree of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aphtha</span>, or <span class="smcap">thrush</span>, is
another trouble of the sucking calf, showing itself as a white, curdy elevation
on the tongue, lips, cheeks, or gums, and when detached leaving a raw, red,
angry surface. It is due to the growth of a vegetable parasite long recognized
as the <em>O&iuml;dium albicans</em> (<em>Saccharomyces albicans</em>). It is easily removed by
rubbing with powdered borax, but inasmuch as other colonies are liable to start
either in the mouth or in the pharynx, gullet, or stomach, it is well to give a
dose of one-half dram of hyposulphite of soda in water day by day for several
days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rickets</span> is not a common disease in calves, and
comes on, if at all, later than those we have been considering. It consists in
softening and friability of the bones from a deficiency of lime salts, and
appears to be mainly connected with an inherited weakness of constitution,
unsuitable feeding, cold, close, damp buildings, microbian infection, and other
conditions inimical to health. The prevention and treatment of rickets consists
essentially in the improvement of the digestion and general health; hence
sunshine, open air, exercise, nourishing food, and tonics are indicated. (See

<p>Without attempting to burden the reader with the technical names and a
scientific classification of each, it appears desirable to describe some of the
characteristics of forms in general and of a few classes into which they may be
divided, leaving the special study of individual bones to the illustrations of
the skeleton (<a href="#PLATE_XXV">Pl. XXV</a>), which will serve better than a
great deal of writing to fix in the mind of the reader the location, relation,
and function of each one. In early fetal life the place of bone is supplied by
temporary cartilage, which gradually changes to bone. For convenience of study,
bones may be said to be composed of a form of dense connective tissue
impregnated with lime salts and to contain two elementary
constituents&mdash;the organic or animal and the inorganic or earthy. In young
animals the former predominates; with increasing years the relative proportions
of the two change, so that when advanced age is reached the proportion of
inorganic far exceeds the organic. The gradual change with advancing years from
organic to inorganic has the effect of rendering the bone harder and more
brittle, and though it is stronger, the reparative process is slower when
injury does occur.</p>

<p>The bones are nourished in two ways: First, from the outside through their
covering, called the periosteum&mdash;the thin, strong mem<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>brane that covers
every part of the bone except the articular surface of the joints; and, second,
from within through the minute branches of blood vessels which pass into the
bones through holes (foramina) on their surface and are distributed in the soft
structure (medulla) of the inside. The structure of the bone is divided into
two parts&mdash;the compact or hard material of the outside, which gives
strength and is more abundant in the shafts of long bones, and the cancellated,
softer tissue of the inside, which affords accommodation to the blood vessels
necessary for the nourishment of that part of the structure.</p>

<p>In shape, bones are divided into three classes&mdash;long, flat, and short.
The long bones are the ribs and those mostly found in the limbs; the flat bones
are found in the head, the shoulder, and the pelvis; the short bones in the
spinal column and in the lower portions of the limbs.</p>

<p>With this little introduction, which seems almost indispensable, we will
proceed at once to the consideration of diseases of bones, for they undergo
disease processes like any other living tissue.</p>

<h4>OSTEITIS.</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the compact structure of bones (osteitis) may be either
acute or chronic, and may involve the whole extent of the bone affected or may
be confined to only a portion of it. This inflammation results from injury,
such as concussion, laceration, or a crushing bruise; also from specific
influences, as in actinomycosis (lumpy jaw) or cases of foul foot. The latter
affection frequently involves the bones, and for this reason the pastern is the
most frequent seat of osteitis. There is dull pain on pressure and a painful
swelling of bone when pus is present. Suppuration may involve the overlying
soft tissues, causing an abscess, which may finally break through the skin. The
inflammatory condition sometimes assumes an ulcerated form (caries) or from
interrupted nutrition of the part deprived of the blood necessary to its
nourishment may cause death of a large section of bone (necrosis); this dead
fragment (sequestrum), becoming separated from the main portion of bone, acts
as a foreign body.</p>

<p>Treatment&mdash;This consists in resting the affected part and in giving
vent at the earliest possible moment to whatever pus may be present. Free
drainage should then be maintained. Apply dressings of lactic acid or inject
with 5 per cent zinc-chlorid solution and pack with tampons of cotton soaked in
antiseptic solutions. A laxative to keep the bowels moving freely is the only
internal treatment necessary.</p>

<h4>PERIOSTITIS.</h4>

<p>This disease is an inflammation of the external covering of bone
(periosteum) and is usually produced by wounds, pressure, or crush
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>ing the part.
The periosteum is well supplied with sensitive nerve endings and when inflamed
is very sensitive to pressure and may cause lameness. This condition is often
difficult to determine, and even an acute observer may fail to locate the point
of its existence. There are three forms of periostitis&mdash;aseptic, purulent,
and fibrous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aseptic periostitis</span> when it becomes chronic
causes such a bony enlargement (exostosis) as is seen in the callous formation
following the fracture of a bone. The formation of such a tumor or enlargement
on the surface of a bone is liable to occur in any part of the bone covered
with periosteum, and when found near a joint involving two or more bones it is
liable to result in their union (anchylosis).</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Applications of cold water to check the inflammatory
processes is indicated for the first few days in aseptic periostitis, followed
by hot fomentations to hurry resorption of fluids. Massage should then be given
with camphor ointment, mercurial ointment, soap liniment, or Lugol's solution.
In the chronic form point firing or a biniodid-of-mercury blister will be found
beneficial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purulent periostitis</span> follows wounds which reach
the periosteum and become infected, as observed in compound fractures, or it
may result from advancing purulent conditions in neighboring structures, as in
foul foot. It may also occur in the course of an infectious disease, when small
abscesses are formed under the periosteum (subperiosteal abscess). It may lead
to necrosis of the bone or a fistulous tract from the bone to the surface.
There is usually much pain and fever, and the odor from the wound is
offensive.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In this form of periostitis the periosteum should be freely
incised, followed either by continuous irrigation or frequent injection of the
wound with antiseptic solutions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fibrous periostitis</span>.&mdash;This form of the
disease consists in the thickening of the outer layer of the periosteum from
the inflammation reaching it from neighboring structures. This newly formed
fibrous tissue may become ossified or may transmit the inflammation to the
deeper bony structures. It is frequently seen in cases in which there has been
an intense inflammation of the skin close to an underlying bone.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment should be the same as that recommended for
aseptic periostitis.</p>

<h4>OSTEOMYELITIS.</h4>

<p>This term refers to an inflammation of the bone marrow, which is most
commonly seen following the bacterial infection of a compound fracture and
usually results in pus formation. The bone is melted away and pus escapes from
the bone under the periosteum, involving the soft tissues. It is principally
confined to the long bones and seldom affects more than one.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The bone should be opened for the purpose of curetting out
the diseased portion of the marrow cavity and removing all the necrotic pieces
of bone. This should be undertaken only by a competent veterinarian. The
after-treatment consists in tamponing the wound with pledgets of iodoform gauze
or a mixture of iodoform 1 part and glycerin 4 parts. The wound in the soft
tissue should be kept open until the cavity in the bone has filled with
granulation tissue.</p>

<h4>RICKETS.</h4>

<p>This disease, also called "rachitis," is an inflammatory affection of young,
growing bones, and mostly involves the ribs and long bones of the legs. It
consists in a failure of the organism to deposit lime salts in bone, and for
this reason the bones do not ossify so rapidly as they should. The
cartilaginous ends of the bones grow rapidly, but ossification does not keep
pace with it. The bones become long and their ends bend at the joints, the legs
become crooked, and the joints are large and irregular. All the bones affected
with this disease are thicker than normal, and the gait of the animal is stiff
and painful. A row of bony enlargements may be found where the ribs articulate
with the cartilages connecting them with the breastbone and is called the
"beaded line." A catarrhal condition of the digestive tract is usually
observed. The disease may result from an inherited weakness of constitution,
poor hygienic surroundings, or improper diet. Calves and foals are less
frequently affected with rickets than dogs and pigs.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The affected animal should have nourishing feed containing
a proper quantity of lime salts. Outdoor exercise and plenty of fresh air are
indispensable. Limewater should be given once daily for drinking purposes and
ground bone meal mixed with the food. Phosphorus, one-fortieth of a grain, and
calcium phosphate, 1 dram, given twice daily to a 2-month-old calf, and
proportionally increased for older animals, has proved efficacious in this
disease. In some cases the long bones of the limbs are too weak at birth to
support the weight of the animal, and temporary splints, carefully padded and
wrapped on with some soft bandages, become necessary.</p>

<h4>OSTEOMALACIA (CREEPS).</h4>

<p>This is a condition of bone brittleness or softening of bone found usually
in adult life. It consists in the decalcification of mature bone, with the
advancing diminution of the compact portion of bone by absorption. The
periosteum strips very easily from the bone. This disease is seen in milch cows
during the period of heavy lacta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268"
id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>tion or in the later stages of pregnancy, and
the greater the yield of milk the more rapid the progress of the disease.
Heifers with their first calves are frequently affected, as these animals
require a considerable quantity of mineral salts for their own growth and for
the nourishment of their offspring.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;In marked cases there is a gradual emaciation and symptoms
of gastrointestinal catarrh, with depraved appetite, the animal eating manure,
decayed wood, dirt, leather, etc. Muscular weakness is prominent, together with
muscle tremors, which simulate chills, but are not accompanied with any rise of
temperature. The animal has a stiff, laborious gait; there is pain and swelling
of the joints, and constant shifting of the weight from one leg to another. The
restricted movements of the joints are frequently accompanied with a crackling
sound, which has caused the name of "creeps" to be applied to the disease. The
coat is dull and rough and the skin dry and hidebound. The animal is subject to
frequent sprains or fracture of bones without apparent cause, as in lying down
or turning around, and when such fractures occur they are difficult to unite.
The bones principally involved are the upper bones of the legs, the haunch
bone, and the middle bones of the spinal column. The disease in this country is
confined to localized areas in the Southwest, known as the "alkali districts,"
and in the old dairy sections of New York State. The cause of this affection is
the insufficiency of lime salts in the food, also to feeding hay of low, damp
pastures, kitchen slops, and potatoes, or to overstocking lands. It occurs on
old, worn-out soil poor in lime salts, and has also been observed to follow a
dry season.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;This should consist in a change of feed and the artificial
feeding of lime salts, such as magnesium and sodium phosphate. Feed rich in
mineral salts may be given, such as beans, cowpeas, oats, cottonseed
meal, or wheat bran. Cottonseed meal is one of the best feeds for this purpose,
but it should be fed carefully, as too large quantities of it are injurious to
cows. Phosphorus may also be given in one-fourth grain doses twice daily,
together with a tablespoonful of powdered bone meal or crude calcium phosphate
at each meal. Ordinary lime dissolved in drinking water (limewater) will also
be found efficacious in combating this disease, and can be provided at slight
expense. A change of pasture to a locality where the disease is unknown and a
free supply of common salt and bone meal will be the most convenient method of
treating range cattle.</p>

<h4>SPRAINS.</h4>

<p>The most common accident occurring to bones and joints is a sprain of the
ligaments uniting the bones, or the tendons uniting the muscles and bones. A
sprain is the result of a sudden forcing of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269"
id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>joint in an unnatural direction, or, if in a
natural direction, beyond the power of the ligament or tendon to
restrain it properly, so that part of the fibers of either are ruptured. When
such an accident occurs pain is immediately inflicted, varying in degree with
the extent of the injury, which is soon followed by swelling, with more or less
heat and tenderness. If the seat of the injury be in any of the limbs, lameness
is likely to result. Of the causes of sprain, slipping on ice or a wet floor,
playing, and fighting with another animal are the most common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sprain of the shoulder joint</span>.&mdash;This is
liable to occur from any of the causes mentioned above or from the animal
slipping suddenly into a rut or hole. When such an accident occurs, sudden
lameness will attract attention. The animal will be noticed to drag the leg
when walking and to carry it in a circular direction, outward and forward, at
each step. The leg should be carefully examined, pressure over the joint
causing the animal to evince pain. If the person making the examination is in
doubt, it is well to make a comparison between the shoulders by pressing first
on one and then the other. After such an accident the animal should be tied up
so as to limit so far as possible the use of the injured joint.</p>

<p>Soft feed should be given with a view of keeping the bowels acting
freely.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;During the first three days the treatment should consist of
cold-water irrigation to check the inflammation and relieve the pain. Hot
fomentations may then be applied to hasten the absorption of the inflammatory
fluids. When the pain has somewhat abated, equal parts of mercurial ointment
and green soap may be rubbed into the swollen tissue. Should lameness continue
after the tenth day, good results will be obtained from the application of a
blister. This may be done by carefully clipping off the hair over the joint,
including a surface of 4 or 5 inches in circumference, and rubbing in the
following preparation:</p>

<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Powdered cantharides</td>
      <td align="right">dram</td>
      <td align="right">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Biniodid of mercury</td>
      <td align="right">do</td>
      <td align="right">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Vaseline</td>
      <td align="right">ounce</td>
      <td align="right">1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The animal's head should be carefully tied until the third day, to prevent
its licking the blister. The blistered surface should then be smeared with lard
or vaseline every other day until the scabs fall off. Gentle exercise should be
allowed after the fourth or fifth day from the application of the blister. If
the lameness still remains the blister may be repeated in three weeks or a
month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sprain of the fetlock</span>.&mdash;This may occur from
misstep when the animal is moving rapidly, and the twisting or wrenching of the
foot is sufficient to rupture partially the ligaments which bind the bones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
together at that part. Such an accident also frequently occurs by the foot
getting fastened in a hole in the floor; the wrenching is the result of the
animal's attempt to liberate it. Lameness, followed by swelling of the joint
and pain when it is handled, or when the animal moves the joint, and heat, are
the more noticeable symptoms. If the sprain is very severe, the animal
occasionally does not bear its weight on the limb.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The most important consideration in the treatment of this
affection is rest, which is best enforced by keeping the animal in the stall
and placing strong, muslin bandages about the inflamed joint. As in the sprain
of the shoulder, cold water in the form of douches, continuous irrigation with
hose or soaking tub, or finely chopped ice poultices are indicated for the
first three days. Following this apply a Priessnitz bandage<a
name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> moderately tight about the joint, which not only
conduces to rest, but also favors absorption. Massage with stimulating
liniments, such as soap or camphor, may later be applied to the affected
parts.</p>

<p>If the lameness has not disappeared by the tenth day, the blister advised
for the sprain of the shoulder should be applied and the same precautions
observed as to tying the animal's head and subsequent smearing with vaseline.
When a blister is applied in this locality, the back part of the heel should be
first filled with lard or vaseline, and care taken to prevent any of the
blistering preparation from coming in contact with the skin of that part. If
this precaution is not observed, scratches may ensue and prove troublesome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sprain of the hip</span>.&mdash;This is liable to result
from the animal's slipping in such way as to spread the hind feet wide apart.
The patient goes stiff in the hind legs, or lame in one hind leg, walking with
a straddling gait and swinging the leg outward as it is carried forward.
Tenderness may occasionally be detected on pressure, but owing to the heavy
covering of muscles outside the joint this test is not always reliable.</p>

<p>In the acute cases give rest and cold local applications. After the fourth
or fifth day the blister mentioned for sprain of the shoulder may be applied
with advantage, and if this proves insufficient, as a last resort we may fire
in points over the joint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sprain of the back</span>.&mdash;Sprain of the back,
particularly in the region of the loins, is not an uncommon accident among
cattle. It is liable to occur from the animals slipping with both hind feet
side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
wise so as to twist the back, or from slipping violently backward so that
great stress is thrown on the loins. The patient moves with difficulty, using
the hind parts in a guarded manner, as if afraid of causing severe pain.
Occasionally, if the sprain is severe, the animal will rise with difficulty.
Pressure on the back in the immediate region of the loins causes pain. Such
cases may be mistaken for paralysis, and, in fact, in severe cases, during the
early stages of the injury, although the nerve supply is not interfered with,
the injury to the muscles and resulting pain is so great that the condition is
almost equal to paralysis, although liable to be attended with more favorable
results. Hot applications, such as blankets wrung out of hot water and changed
often, will be likely to afford relief during the earlier stages. Afterwards
the blister mentioned for sprain of the shoulder may be applied with advantage.</p>

<h4>FRACTURES (BROKEN BONES).</h4>

<p>Bones may be accidentally broken in many ways and from different causes.
Fractures in general are liable to be produced by external force suddenly and
violently applied, either directly to the part or at a distance, the force
being transmitted through the stronger bones until it expends itself by
breaking a weaker one remote from the seat of the injury. Occasionally violent
contraction of muscles is sufficient to break a bone. Certain bones, those of
the limbs in particular, owing to their exposed position, are more liable to
fracture than others. Owing to certain predisposing causes, such as age, habit,
or hereditary constitutional weakness, the bones of some animals are more
easily fractured than those of others. The bones of an animal advanced in years
are more subject to fracture because of the preponderance of inorganic matter
rendering them more brittle. They are also occasionally rendered liable to
fracture by a previously existing diseased condition. Fractures are divided
into four classes&mdash;partial, simple, compound, and comminuted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Partial fractures</span>.&mdash;Partial fractures are
those which are liable to occur in a young animal in which the preponderance of
animal matter or the semicartilaginous condition of the bone renders it tough,
so that even when considerable force is applied the bone bends, breaking on the
side opposite that to which the force was applied, after the manner in which a
green stick bends and breaks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simple fractures</span>. Simple fracture is one in which
the bone is severed in two parts, transversely, longitudinally, or obliquely,
without serious injury to the adjoining structures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Compound fractures</span>.&mdash;Compound fracture is
one in which there is an open wound permitting the air to communicate with the
ends of the broken bones.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comminuted fractures</span>.&mdash;Comminuted fracture
is one in which the bone is shattered or divided into a number of fragments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Complicated fractures</span>.&mdash;Complicated fracture
is one in which other structures surrounding the bones are injured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General symptoms of fracture</span>.&mdash;When a
fracture of one or more of the large bones of a limb occurs, symptoms are sure
to be well marked. After the accident the animal refuses to touch the foot to
the ground and, if compelled to move, does so with great pain and reluctance.
There is more or less shortening of the limb, with trembling of the muscles in
the vicinity of the injury; deformity, and increased mobility, so that, instead
of the natural joints of the limb and the natural, muscular control of their
motion, a new joint, over which the animal has no control, is formed where the
fracture occurred. As the leg, shortened by the ends of the bones being forced
past one another from the muscular contraction which invariably takes place,
hangs dependent from the body it swings in an awkward and unnatural manner,
permitting the toe and foot to assume positions in their relations to other
parts of the body which otherwise would be impossible. If the fractured bone is
so situated that the parts may be moved one upon another, a grating sound,
known as crepitus, will be heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General treatment of fractures</span>.&mdash;When a
fracture occurs, the advisability of attempting treatment must first be
determined. If the animal is young, valuable, and of reasonably quiet
temperament, and the fracture is not too great in extent, the chances of
recovery are fair. On the other hand, if the animal should be of little value,
irritable, advanced in years, and the fracture is a serious compound or
comminuted one, the wiser course would generally be to put the creature out of
its misery.</p>

<p>Having determined to attempt treatment, no time should be lost in restoring
the parts as nearly as possible to their natural position and retaining them
there. If the ends of the bones have been drawn one past the other, they should
be drawn out by firm and continuous tension, until they again assume the
position in which they were before the accident. All this can better be done
before the swelling (which is sure to result) takes place. If the swelling has
occurred before the injury is noticed, do not attempt to treat it, but proceed
at once to treat the fracture as though the swelling were not present, for no
step can be taken toward recovery until the ends of the bone have been restored
to their proper position. When that is done and proper appliances have been
used to prevent them from being again misplaced, the swelling, which is the
result of irritation, will be relieved. In selecting the appliances to be used
in the treatment of fracture the judgment and ingenuity of the operator are of
much importance. Splints, made of wood shaped to fit the limb and padded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>with
soft material where they come in contact with bony prominences, and held in
position by means of bandages, are the oldest method, and with some are still
most popular. The fracture pads used in human surgery, and for sale in surgical
depots, are very convenient. After being dipped in water they may be molded to
fit the limb and be retained by means of bandages. Heavy sole leather is also
used after being soaked in warm water and molded to the shape of the limb and
holes cut in it to fit over any sharp irregularities in the natural shape of
the bones. Gutta-percha sheets are also used and answer well. They are prepared
and used in the same way as the leather.</p>

<p>Another and perhaps the simplest of all methods is the application of a
plaster-of-Paris bandage, which is made as follows: Strips of thin cheesecloth
3 inches wide and 8 or 9 feet long are laid flat on a board and on them is
spread a layer of plaster of Paris about one-eighth of an inch thick; then,
starting at one end, roll carefully so as to gather the plaster in between the
layers of the bandage. It is of course important that the cloth be thin and the
plaster of Paris fresh and active. After preparing four or five of such
bandages the operator is ready to dress the fracture, which, after the parts
have been brought into position, should be done by covering all that part of
the limb to which the plaster-of-Paris bandage is to be applied with a single
layer of the dry bandage, letting it extend both above and below the part to
which the plaster bandage is to be applied and including under the folds of the
dry bandage at each end a layer of absorbent cotton, which is intended to form
a pad to prevent the ends of the plaster bandage from chafing the skin beneath.
When this is done one of the plaster bandages should be placed in a vessel of
water and allowed to remain till the air bubbles have ceased to rise from it,
which will generally indicate that it is soaked through. Then, taking it in the
hand, wind it carefully around and around the limb, unrolling the bandage as it
is wound around the limb, occasionally smoothing down the plaster of Paris.
Should it form roughly or in ridges the hand may be dipped in water to impart
increased moisture to it. When about finished with one bandage, place another
one in the water, so that the winding operation may be continued without delay.
The bandages should be applied till the cast is from one-half to
three-quarters of an inch thick, then gently restrain the animal for one-half
or three-quarters of an hour till the plaster is hardened. Any of the
appliances used should be so manipulated as to prevent absolutely any motion of
the detached parts. If the fracture is near a joint, it is generally best to
include the joint in the appliance. The part of the limb below the bandage
should be carefully and firmly wrapped with an ordinary cotton bandage all the
way from the plaster bandage down to the hoof. This last bandage <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>will tend to prevent
swelling, which is liable to occur, the result of the dependent position in
which the animal is forced by nature to keep the injured limb.</p>

<p>When plaster-of-Paris bandages are applied to a compound fracture the
injured part may be previously dressed with a small, thick pad of cotton
immediately over the wound. In applying the bandage the operator may with a
little care so arrange it as to keep the folds of the bandages off the cotton,
or have only a thin layer over it, which may be easily cut out and the cotton
removed, leaving a convenient opening through which to dress the wound without
removing the bandage. The ends of the bandage or other appliance should be
carefully watched to see that the skin does not become chafed, particularly at
the lower end. If the bandage should become weak or broken at any part, it may
be strengthened without removal by applying other bandages immediately over it.
If swelling has taken place before the bandage has been applied, there is
liable to be some loosening as it disappears, and even without the swelling
there may be a tendency of the bandage to slide downward. This may be overcome
by fastening it to a suspender attached to a surcingle or passed over the body
and attached to the opposite leg. If the looseness can not be overcome in this
way, the space may be filled by pouring in a thin paste of plaster of Paris. A
better method, however, is to remove the bandage and apply another. Owing to
the hardness of the bandage it will be removed with some difficulty. A deep
groove should be cut down completely through it on the opposite sides. This may
be done with a chisel and a small hammer if the bandage is carefully held by an
assistant so that the concussion of the blows is not transmitted to the injured
bones. The patient should have a roomy stall, and should be tied by the head to
prevent any attempts to move around. In some cases slings have been used.
Ordinarily, however, they are not satisfactory in cattle practice, and if
applied should be for only a few days at a time, and with a view to lessen the
animal's disposition to lie down, rather than to prevent it. When they are used
continuously the pressure on the abdomen may interfere with digestion and the
general health of the animal.</p>

<p><em>Modes of union</em>.&mdash;The animal should be kept as quiet as possible and
given such feed as will have a tendency to keep the bowels slightly relaxed.
The success of the operation depends chiefly on the skill of the operator, but
not alone in the selection and use of the appliances, for as much attention
must be given to subsequent management. The patients are restless, and a
single awkward motion may undo the work of weeks so far as the union of the
parts of the bone is concerned. Union takes place after the same process and,
if the conditions are favorable, with greater rapidity than in the human being.
The injury that caused the fracture is almost sure to <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>have extended to some of
the adjacent tissues, and even though the fracture may be of the simplest type
there is almost sure to be considerable hemorrhage around the ends of the
broken bone. This, however, is unimportant if the skin remains intact, unless a
very large vessel should be injured, or the fracture should open some of the
important cavities of the body, in which case a fatal hemorrhage may result.
If, on the other hand, the fracture is compound the external opening furnishes
a fertile field for the lodgment of disease-producing germs.</p>

<p>Unless great care is taken in such cases, a suppurative process is liable to
be established which will seriously interfere with, if not entirely arrest, the
process of union between the bones; or it may become so serious as to endanger
the general health of the animal and even be attended with fatal results. This
last danger is greater if the injury has occurred to the bones of the arm or
thigh. In such cases, owing to the dense covering of fascia which ensheathes
the muscular covering pus is liable to be imprisoned, and, burrowing downward,
saturate the whole structure, not only endangering the limb, but, by
absorption, may set up blood poisoning and seriously interfere with the general
health of the patient, even to causing death. In order so far as possible to
prevent such an unfortunate complication, the wound should be carefully
cleansed with a mild solution of carbolic acid, then dusted over with iodoform
before the bandages are applied, and cleansed and dressed daily in the same
way. After dressing, always cover with absorbent cotton. In the early process
of union an exudation of lymph takes place, which is at first fluid, gradually
becoming thicker and firmer till it forms a callus, known as the external or
ensheathing callus, in the shape of a ring or ferrule surrounding the detached
portions of the bone. It occasionally happens that this callus forms only at
the ends of the bones, filling the spaces that exist between them, when it is
known as the intermediate callus. The process of union may be divided into five
stages. In the first stage, including the first eight days, the detached
portions of the bone and the sharp projections that are not sufficiently
nourished are absorbed; the blood which escaped into the surrounding tissues,
the result of the injury, is gradually absorbed, and the effused lymph, which
is ultimately to constitute the temporary cartilage, takes it place. In the
second stage, from the tenth to the twentieth day, the tumor or callus is
formed and fibrocartilage is developed inside and around the exposed end of the
bone. In the third stage, extending from the twentieth to the fortieth or
fiftieth day, according to the age and strength of the animal, the
fibrocartilaginous structure undergoes a change and is gradually converted into
bone, forming a ferrule on the outside and a plug on the inside, <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>which serve to hold the part
in position. In the fourth stage, extending to about the sixth month, the whole
of the new structure is converted into bone. In the fifth stage, extending
to the end of the first year, the callus is absorbed, being no longer
necessary, and the connection between the cavities of the two bones is
again established.</p>

<p><em>Common complications</em>.&mdash;The process of union just described is healthy
and normal. Diseased conditions may at any time supervene during the treatment
and render the operation unsuccessful. In the case of compound fracture, the
open wound communicating with the ends of the bones, a septic condition is
liable to arise which may become so serious as to endanger the animal's life
and bring about conditions which in human surgery would indicate amputation.
Although that operation is not a general one in veterinary practice, there is
no reason why it should not be attempted as a last resort, particularly if the
animal is valuable or is one whose existence is necessary in order to
perpetuate some valuable strain. Even in the simplest form of fracture, if the
splints or bandages are improperly applied and the fractured bone left so
loosely guarded that the broken ends move one upon another, the formation of
the calluses previously described is liable to be interfered with, and in place
of a strong, rigid, and healthy union a formation of elastic cartilage is the
result. This false structure unites the broken ends of the bones in such way
that they move one upon another, depriving the bone of its stability and
usefulness. When once the healthy process of union is interrupted in the manner
just described, it is again established with great difficulty. It no longer
does any good to continue the restraining power; in fact, the change of the
temporary cartilage into bone is more liable to be reestablished if the parts
move violently upon each other for a short time so as to set up and renew the
process of inflammation. Then if the restraint is again applied there is some
chance of union. In order so far as possible to avoid this danger, care should
be taken to see that the bandage fits closely and that it is kept on till there
is no longer any danger but that a perfect union has taken place. It is
impossible to say at just what time the splints or bandages can safely be
removed. In a young and healthy animal of quiet temperament, if the parts have
been firmly held in position throughout the whole time, from 30 to 40 days may
be regarded as reasonably safe. Under more unfavorable conditions as to age,
vitality, and restraint, the period would better be extended to 60 days, if the
general condition of the animal is such as to permit of so long a continuance.
After the appliance has been removed the animal should be allowed to stand
quiet for a few days, then be given very gentle exercise, gradually increased
for a week or 10 days, by which time the patient will be so far recovered as to
be placed in pasture. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">
[Pg 277]</a></span>It should, however, be alone for a time, so as not to
take any chance of injury from fighting or other accidents that association
with other animals might involve.</p>

<h4>SPECIAL FRACTURES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the horns</span>.&mdash;Of the special
fractures liable to occur, that of the horn is perhaps the most common. It is
always the result of violent mechanical means, such as blows, injury occurring
while fighting, or from the animal getting its head locked in some manner while
feeding from a rack. When it occurs there are two ways in which the injury may
affect the animal. First and most common, the horny crust is liable to be
stripped from the bony projection which it covers. Second, the crust and bone
may both be broken or bent down, the fracture occurring in that case at the
root of the horn and involving part of the bones of the head in the immediate
vicinity. In the first case, if the horny covering is knocked off, little
attention is necessary. The animal may be relieved from suffering if the stump
is smeared with pine tar and wrapped in cloth. If the core is much lacerated,
perhaps it would be better to amputate. The necessity for such operation must
be determined by the condition of the injury, influenced to some extent by the
owner's ideas on the subject. When the operation is performed, it should be
done with a sharp, fine-toothed saw, and by sawing the horn off close enough to
include a little of the skin and hair around its base. The practice of
dehorning has grown popular in many parts of the country. It is a simple
operation, and, although attended with some immediate suffering, does not
produce serious constitutional disturbance. The advisability of performing the
operation on all cattle is a question of expediency and must be justified by
the expectation of benefit on the part of the feeder. If the horn should be
broken so that the core and crust are bent out of shape without the detachment
of one from the other, it may be restored to its normal position and retained
there by means of a splint made to fit across the back of the head, so as to be
laced to both horns, the sound horn serving to hold the broken one in position.
Such a splint may be fastened on by means of either a wire or cord and allowed
to remain six weeks or two months.</p>

<p>If both the horn and core have been broken off, bleeding is usually severe
and should be checked by astringents, such as alum, or by pressure. After the
hemorrhage has ceased the exposed portion of the fracture should be covered
with pine tar, with or without a bandage. An imperfect growth of horn will in
due time cover the exposed bone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures of the bones of the face</span>.&mdash;These
occasionally occur, and when over the cavities of the nose produce depression,
disfigure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a>
</span>ment, and impeded respiration, owing to the lessening of the caliber
of the nasal passages.</p>

<p>When such accident occurs, the depressed bone should be gently forced back
to place by introducing the finger in the nostril, or if the fracture is too
far up for this, a probe may be passed and the parts retained by placing
immediately over it a plaster of thin leather or strong canvas smeared
with tar, extending out to the sound surroundings, taking care to embed the
hair over the fractured portion in the tar of the plaster, so that it will be
firmly held and prevented from again becoming depressed. If only one nostril is
involved, the depressed portion may be held in position by packing that nostril
with absorbent cotton. This practice, however, has the objection of giving the
animal great discomfort and in some cases a disposition to aggravate the
injury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the skull (cranium)</span>.&mdash;Fractures
of the bones forming the cavity in which the brain is situated are, owing to
their strength, comparatively rare among cattle. Such an accident can only be
the result of external violence, and it is hardly possible that it could occur
without some fragment of the broken bone pressing upon the brain so as to cause
coma or other severe nervous derangement, or even death.</p>

<p>If the animal survives the first shock, the efforts should be directed
toward relieving the pressure, which may be done by making an opening in the
bone (trephining), and with a hook drawing the depressed part outward.
Interference is not so liable to be attended with good results as to be
warranted in all cases. The effects of a very severe shock which may not have
produced a fracture, although the symptoms were alarming, will in many cases
pass off, leaving the animal in a better condition than if an operation had
been performed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the lower jaw</span>.&mdash;This
occasionally occurs, and is more liable to result from the kick of a horse than
from any other cause. The front part of the jaw may be split or shattered in
any direction in which the force may have been applied. Bloody discharges from
the mouth and failure to eat or ruminate are symptoms most likely to attract
attention.</p>

<p>The treatment is simple and consists in first removing detached pieces of
bone, then drawing the parts together and retaining them by means of pieces of
copper wire fastened around the teeth, and feeding the animal on sloppy feed
until recovery takes place. The wound should be dressed once or twice a day
with a 3 per cent solution of carbolic acid, forced gently in with a syringe,
so as to remove any feed which may have become impacted and interfere with the
healing process.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the vertebra (spinal column)</span>.&mdash;
This is not so common among cattle as other animals. If the fracture should be
through the body of the bone, there may be pressure on or laceration of the
spinal cord, causing paralysis of all parts posterior to the seat of injury.
Fractures of the prominences on a vertebra occasionally occur without interfering
with the canal in which the spinal cord is situated. Such accidents are liable
to pass unnoticed, for, although the animal may suffer considerable pain, it
may not be manifested in such way as to attract attention, and the deep
covering of muscles serves effectually to conceal the injury. When the fracture
occurs in the upper part of the neck, paralysis of the muscles used in
respiration must result, and death from asphyxia very shortly ensues. The
more common accident is to the loins, and when a fracture of the body of a vertebra
occurs in this region so as to produce pressure on the spinal cord, paralysis
of the hind legs and quarters is the result. Diagnosis of such an accident is
more difficult than in the case of any other fracture. The parts can not be
moved one upon another so that crepitus is noticeable. The heavy coating of
muscles conceals irregularities of shape, which otherwise may attract attention.
About the only reliable symptom is paralysis or loss of use and sensation of
the parts posterior to the injury. Careful examination may reveal the seat
of the injury. If it was the result of a blow, there may be some abrasion
of the skin. The diagnosis is only important as an aid in determining the
proper course to pursue.</p>

<p>If paralysis is present and a depression or irregularity of the spinal
column is so apparent as to leave no doubt of the existence of a fracture, the
only alternative is to destroy the animal, for of recovery there can be no
hope. If, on the other hand, the paralysis is incomplete and there is no
depression or irregularity of the spinal column or other evidence of fracture,
the patient should be made as comfortable as possible by being placed in a
well-bedded box stall and a few days permitted to elapse before the case is
abandoned. The symptoms last described may possibly be the result of a severe
strain of the muscles of the loins, in which case an improvement will soon be
noticeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures of the pelvis</span>.&mdash;The pelvis, or
bony framework which gives shape to the posterior part of the body, is liable
to fracture in many ways. A common one is by a separation of the two bones
which constitute the whole pelvis along the bottom and center line (symphysis
pubis). In early life the two bones are separate and distinct. The union
between them, which is at first cartilaginous, undergoes a change and is
converted into bone, so that in adult life the whole pelvis is practically one
bone. The point on which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280"
id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>two bones are united is weaker than the adjoining
parts of the bone. When an animal slips violently, spreading the legs wide
apart, the weaker materials give way and the bones are divided. If the accident
is noticed when it occurs, it is likely to throw light on the nature of the
injury. The animal will immediately go stiff behind, the legs being spread
apart. Further examination may be made by introducing the hand, previously
carefully oiled, into the rectum or vagina and pressing down along the central
line, which will cause the patient to evince acute pain. In this case no
appliance can be used to advantage. The animal should be tied in a stall until
the parts become reunited and the lameness disappears.</p>

<p>Fracture of the posterior parts of the bone (ischium), which forms the point
of the buttocks occasionally occurs. The buttock on the injured side will be
less prominent than the other. Careful manipulation will generally move the
parts so that crepitus may be recognized. If the fracture is through the
posterior part of the bone, it is unimportant and deserving of no more
attention than placing the animal in such position as to insure it against
subsequent injury until the bones are united. Some distortion may result, but
not sufficient to warrant interference.</p>

<p>Fracture through the body of the bone on a line with the hip joint
(acetabulum) occasionally, though rarely, occurs, and is nearly always
associated with dislocation of the hip joint and the forcing of the head of the
upper bone of the leg (femur) upward, far out of its place. The violent
contraction of the powerful muscles of the hip renders it impossible to reduce
the dislocation, and even if it were possible the fractured pelvis could not be
held in position, so that the case becomes at once hopeless. It may be
recognized by the animal's standing on three legs, the leg on the injured side
seeming shorter than its fellow and hanging pendulous, the muscles of the hip
violently contracted and hard to the touch. The animal evinces great pain when
the limb is moved. There is liable to be some apparent distortion in the
relations between the point of the hip and the point of the buttock. This will
be more readily noticed by comparing the injured side with the other. The parts
may be moved so as to produce crepitus. The examination may be completed by
introducing the oiled hand into the vagina or rectum, when the two sides of the
pelvis will reveal well-marked differences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the point of the hip</span>.&mdash;The
anterior and external part of the pelvis (ilium), commonly known as the point
of the hip, is liable to fracture, which stock owners describe as "hipping," or
being "hipped," or having the hip "knocked down." This accident may be the
result of crowding while passing through a narrow door, of falling violently on
the point of the hip, or from a violent blow directed downward and forward
against it. The lesion generally <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281"
id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>extends across the flat surface of the bone
from its outer and posterior edge forward and inward. Distortion is liable to
be the only noticeable symptom. The detached portion varies in size in
different cases and with it the resulting deformity. The animal is noticed to
be slightly lame, but this symptom soon disappears. The detached portion of the
bone is drawn downward and away from the main part by the action of the muscles
below, which are so powerful as to render return impossible. The bones
therefore remain permanently separated, union taking place by fibrous callus.
The animal suffers very little inconvenience, and for practical use may be as
serviceable as before the accident, though the distorted appearance depreciates
its value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the ribs</span>.&mdash;Such an occurrence
can take place only as the result of a direct injury, as from blows or
crowding. The posterior ribs, being more exposed, are more liable to fracture.
Pain in moving, slight swelling over the seat of injury, and difficult
breathing are obvious symptoms. If the fracture is complete, crepitation may be
occasionally noticed by placing the hand flat over the injured part, carefully
observing the motion as the chest contracts and expands during respiration.
This symptom is more noticeable when the animal coughs. Unless the point of the
broken bone penetrates the cavity of the chest the fracture is usually
unimportant and calls for no treatment other than quiet. If the breathing is
very labored and attended with much pain, motion may be limited by applying a
wide bandage firmly around the chest. The animal should be restricted in the
amount of feed and water for a few days, the stomach being kept as nearly empty
as possible. Sloppy feed should be given to encourage, as much as possible,
free action of the diaphragm in breathing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of bones of the limbs</span>.&mdash;On this
subject much has been said in the preceding remarks on general fractures.
As a rule, fracture through one of the large bones of the shoulder (scapula) or
thigh (femur) is very difficult to manage. The powerful contraction of the
muscles and the changing shape of the limb resulting from their action renders
it impossible to retain the detached parts of the bone in proper position.
Therefore, though the union should take place, there is almost sure to be
considerable deformity and more or less lameness. Fracture of the arm (humerus)
or leg (tibia) is likely to be attended with better results. The muscular
covering is not so thick, the sheath in which they are held is more tense, and
the change in the shape of the limb from muscular action not so noticeable, the
muscular force not so great, all of which facilitate replacing the dislodged
ends and retaining them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the knee (carpus) and hock
(tarsus)</span>.&mdash;This seldom occurs unless it is the result of a very
violent injury, and is gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282"
id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>erally associated with other injury and serious
complications. Displacement does not generally occur to any considerable
extent. The treatment, of course, consists in holding the limb perfectly quiet
in a natural position, which may be done by the application of long, wooden
splints retained by bandages, or a plaster-of-Paris bandage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures below the knee</span>.&mdash;Fracture of the
long bone below the knee (metacarpus) and hock (metatarsus) is more common. In
young animals of quiet temperament the treatment of simple fractures here is
likely to be attended with good results. On the other hand, a compound fracture
in this region becomes a serious matter. The structures which surround the
bones are so thin that a very small degree of sloughing will expose parts of
the bones and be liable to lead to serious complications and probably fatal
results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures of bones below the fetlock</span>.&mdash;These
fractures are comparatively unimportant unless associated with other serious
injury. The parts can generally be held in position without much difficulty,
and union generally takes place quite rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appliances</span>.&mdash;Of the appliances used in the
treatment of the fracture of limbs above the knee, splints made of wood or iron
strips and bandages are likely to serve best. Below the knee plaster-of-Paris
bandages are preferable. The writer is well aware that many of the standard
authors deprecate the use of the latter, but an extensive experience leads me
to believe that they have many advantages over any of the other appliances when
used alone, and in many ways they may be used with advantage in combination
with others.</p>

<h4>DISLOCATIONS.</h4>

<p>Luxation, or displacement without fracture of the bones forming a joint, is
comparatively rare among cattle. It most frequently occurs in the stifle joint,
where dislocation of the kneepan (patella) takes place. A glance at the
skeleton (<a href="#PLATE_XXV">Pl. XXV</a>) will show the relations better than
they can be described. It will be observed that the small, irregularly shaped
bone (patella) plays on the anterior rounded part of the lower edge of
the thigh bone (femur) and between it and the upper end of the shank bone
(tibia). The outer ridge on the lower end of the thigh bone is less prominent
than the inner one, so that displacement, when it does take place, is by
slipping outward. Such an accident may occur from direct injury or external
force, as a blow, or from slipping. When it does occur the symptoms produced
are somewhat alarming. The animal is unable to draw the leg forward, and either
stands with it thrown back with the toe pointing downward, or, if it should
succeed in getting its weight upon it, holds it firmly on the ground, fearing
to move it. Examination of the outside of the joint will disclose the situation
of the patella outside its proper place. If the operator is not familiar with
the normal appearance of the joint, it is well to make a comparison between the
injured and the sound one. If compelled to move, the animal does so with great
difficulty, jerking the leg which it is unable to bring forward, hopping with
the other, and partially dragging the injured one.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment is simple. A rope 20 feet long should be
applied around the fetlock of the affected leg, passed forward between the
front legs and up over the opposite side of the neck, back over the withers,
and wrapped once behind the elbow around that portion of the rope which passes
between the front legs. The leg is then drawn away from the body and forcibly
pushed forward by an assistant, while another person tightens up the slack in
the rope until the affected leg is off the ground in front of the supporting
leg. The rope is then drawn taut and the assistant grasps the tail and pulls
the cow toward the affected side. The animal makes a lurch to keep from
falling, contracts the muscles, and the patella slips into place with a sharp
click, and the animal walks off as if nothing had happened. If the animal
resists this method of handling, it may suffice to manipulate the dislocated
kneepan by shoving it inward and forward with the heel of the hand while the
affected leg is drawn well forward. Unless some precaution is taken the
accident is liable to recur, as the ligaments have been stretched by the
dislocation till they no longer hold the bone with that firmness necessary to
retain it. The animal should be tied and the foot fastened forward, so that the
patient can just stand on it comfortably, by means of a rope or strap around
the fetlock carried forward between the front legs, around the neck, and tied
on the breast.</p>

<p>Should this accident occur more than once it is a good practice to apply a
blister around the joint, as in the formula recommended for sprain of shoulder,
and observe the precautions as to restraint and subsequent treatment there
recommended. With this one exception dislocations in the ox occurring
independently of other complications are rare.</p>

<p>Dislocation with fracture may occur in any of the joints, and if one is
suspected or discovered, examination should always be made for the other before
treatment is applied. When a fracture occurs near a joint the force
sufficient to rend the bone is liable to be partly exerted on the immediate
tissues, and when the bone gives way the structures of the joints may be
seriously injured. It occasionally happens that the injury to the joint becomes
the most important complication in the treatment of a fracture. In order
clearly to understand the reason for this a few words are necessary in relation
to the structure of joints.</p>

<p>The different pieces constituting the skeleton of the animal body are united
in such manner as to admit of more or less motion one <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>upon another. In some of
the more simple joints the bones fitting one into another are held together by
the dense structures around them, admitting of very little or no movement at
all, as the bones of the head. In other joints the bones are bound together by
dense, cartilaginous structures, admitting of only limited motion, such as the
union of the small bones at the back part of the knee and hock (metacarpal and
metatarsal). In the more nearly perfect form of joint the power of motion
becomes complete and the structures are more complex. The substance of the bone
on its articular surface is not covered with periosteum, but is sheathed in a
dense, thin layer of cartilage, shaped to fit the other surfaces with which it
comes in contact (articular). This layer is thickest toward its center when
covering bony eminences, and is elastic, of a pearly whiteness, and resisting,
though soft enough to be easily cut. The bones forming an articulation are
bound together by numerous ligaments attached to bony prominences. The whole
joint is sealed in by a band or ribbonlike ligament (capsular ligament)
extending around the joint and attached at the outer edge of the articular
surface, uniting the bones and hermetically sealing the cavities of the
articulation. This structure and the articular surface of the bone is covered
by a thin, delicate membrane, known as the "synovial membrane," which secretes
the joint oil (synovia). This fluid is viscid and colorless, or slightly
yellow, and although it does not possess a large quantity of fat, its character
somewhat resembles oil, and it serves the same purpose in lubricating the
joints that oil does to the friction surface of an engine. Although the tissues
of the joint when used in a natural way are able to withstand the effect of
great exertion, when unnaturally used, as they are very delicate and complex,
they are liable to inflammatory and other changes of a very serious nature. The
synovial membrane, and in fact the whole structure of the joint, is susceptible
to injury and serious inflammatory derangement, and the capsular ligament is
liable to be distended from excessive secretion of synovia. The latter process
may be almost noninflammatory, and attended with little inconvenience or
importance other than a blemish to the animal, which in cattle is not serious.
It may occur on the back part of the leg above the fetlock or on the inner and
fore part of the hock, corresponding in its location to windgalls and bog
spavin of the horse. Continuous support by bandages will generally force
reabsorption, and as the limb is not subjected to violent action, as in the
case of the horse, the affection is not so liable to recur.</p>

<h4>SPAVIN.</h4>

<p>Occasionally working oxen that are used in the lumber woods and made to pull
heavily, with bad footing, are afflicted with this condition. When it occurs
lameness is the first symptom. During the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285"
id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>early stages of the disease the
lameness is most severe in the morning, and disappears after the animal is
exercised; it gradually becomes more severe as the disease advances, so that
when the disease is well established the animal is lame continuously. Shortly
after the lameness appears a bunch (exostosis) will be noticed on the inner and
fore part of the affected joint. This bunch differs from bog spavin in that it
is hard, while bog spavin is soft. It increases in size as the disease advances
till the animal is too lame to be used for labor. As the disease is always
attended with considerable pain there is more or less loss of flesh. In the
most advanced stage the animal will step with difficulty, frequently holding
the foot from the ground, or, if forced to take a few steps, stands with it
elevated, twitching with pain. In the earlier stages of the disease only a
small portion of the fore part of the lower, or second, articulation is
involved, but the inflammatory process gradually extends over the whole surface
of the lower joints of the hock. The structures of the joint are broken down
and the bones are united (anchylosis). This process may include any or all of
the three lower joints of the hock. The joint of motion which is situated on
the lower end of the leg bone is seldom involved.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment of spavin in the ox, as in the horse, is likely
to be tedious, and not always resulting in perfect cure. Usually it is best to
fatten the animal for slaughter. If, however, treatment is decided upon, it
should consist of complete rest and counterirritation of the part either by
sharp blisters or the firing iron. It is advisable to try the effect of
blistering first, and for this purpose the following mixture is recommended:</p>

that it can not reach the part to lick it; after the third day grease with lard
every other day until the scabs come off. This blister may be repeated three or
four times at intervals of three weeks. The lameness will generally begin to
disappear about the third or fourth month if the above-described treatment
proves beneficial. Should lameness persist, firing in points by a qualified
veterinarian may effect the desired result and should be tried as a last
resort.</p>

<p>In a case of spavin the cure is not effected by restoring the diseased parts
to their natural condition, but by uniting the bones and obliterating
the joints. If this union extends over the whole articular surface of the
joints affected and is sufficiently strong to prevent any motion of the bones,
the animal will again go sound. The joints <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286"
id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>that are obliterated, not being those of motion,
are not important, so that the animal suffers no inconvenience in their loss.</p>

<h4>RHEUMATISM.</h4>

<p>Rheumatism is a constitutional disease from a specific condition of the
blood and characterized by inflammation of the fibrous structures of the body.
It is usually accompanied with stiffness, lameness, and fever. The parts
affected are usually swollen, but swelling may be lacking. The inflammation may
be transitory; that is, it changes from place to place. The parts usually
affected are the fibrous structures of the joints, tendons, ligaments, and
muscles. The serous membranes and heart may also be affected. According to its
location, rheumatism is specified as articular or muscular. According to its
course, it is designated as acute or chronic.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;Among the factors which are actively causative of rheumatism
may be mentioned exposure to dampness and cold, especially while the animal is
perspiring or fatigued after severe physical exertion. Among other causes often
mentioned are acidity of the blood, nervous derangement, microbes, and
injuries. It occasionally follows another disease, such as pleurisy. The
influence of age and heredity may be considered as secondary or predisposing
causes. Sometimes the disease appears without any apparent cause. On the whole,
it may be said that any of the above-mentioned factors may have more or less
influence on the production of rheumatism, but the specific cause is as yet
unknown.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms of articular rheumatism</em>.&mdash;The symptoms appear suddenly and
with varying degrees of severity. The animal presents a downcast appearance,
with staring coat, horns and ears cold, and the mouth and muzzle hot and dry.
Appetite and rumination may be impaired and followed later or be accompanied at
the same time by constipation. Constipation may be followed by impaction of the
stomach or bowels. Thirst is increased, but the amount of urine voided is
scanty. Respiration and pulse are accelerated, and there is usually a fever,
rising sometimes as high as 108Â° F. The animal prefers to lie down, and when
forced to rise stands with its back arched. The movements are stiff and lame
and cause great pain. The disease may attack one or more joints at the same
time; in fact, it is often symmetrical. One joint may improve while another
becomes affected, thus showing the shifting tendency of the inflammation. The
affected joints, including their tendons, ligaments, and synovial membranes,
may be swollen, hot, and distended with liquid. They are very tender, and, if
treated carelessly or injured, may become infected, thus leading to
suppuration. While rheumatism attacks perhaps more frequently the knees and
fetlocks, it has no special affinity <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287"
id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>for any joint and may attack the stifle,
hip, shoulder, or elbow joint. In mild cases of articular rheumatism, the
animal may fully recover in a few days.</p>

<p>In chronic articular rheumatism there is less tendency of the disease to
shift about, but there is a greater liability of structural change in the
affected joints. This change may consist of induration, exostosis, or even
anchylosis. These structural changes about the joints may lead to permanent
deformity, such as the bending of the neck. Fever is not so constant in the
chronic form as in the acute, and the latter may lapse into the former.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms of muscular rheumatism</em>.&mdash;This form of rheumatism may appear
under the same general conditions as the articular form. The general appearance
of the animal is the same in both forms. The cow usually assumes a recumbent
position, and all the movements made are stiff and lame. The method of rising
or of locomotion indicates pain in certain muscles or groups of muscles, as of
the croup, shoulder, or neck. As in the case of articular rheumatism, the
tendons, ligaments, and synovial membranes may become involved. The
constitutional symptoms in both articular and muscular rheumatism are similar,
so that it is often perplexing to differentiate between the two forms.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;It is somewhat difficult to procure preventive treatment
for cattle, especially when there are large numbers with little or no shelter.
In general, it is advisable to protect the animals so far as possible from
inclement weather conditions, such as cold rains, heavy dews, and frosts. This
is more particularly necessary for animals in poor condition, or those which
are perspiring or fatigued after long physical exertion. Careful feeding is
also essential.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In attempting to treat cattle for rheumatism the first step
is to procure proper shelter and environment. The animal should be quartered in
a large, clean, dry stall, with plenty of light and fresh air, but protected
from strong drafts. There should be an abundance of clean, dry bedding. The
feed should be soft, easily digestible, and slightly laxative, and the animal
should have access to clean, pure, cool water.</p>

<p>For general or constitutional treatment of acute rheumatism, sodium
salicylate is indicated. In order to gain the best results from this drug, it
should be administered with the idea of rapidly saturating the system. To
cattle it may be given in doses of one-half ounce every two hours for ten hours
or until immediate relief is obtained. This drug should not be continued
indefinitely, but may be given once a day after immediate relief has been
obtained, and this single dose continued daily until permanent relief ensues,
when it should be stopped. The use of sodium salicylate in chronic rheumatism
is not advisable on account of the danger of depressing the heart, whose <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>action
is already somewhat impaired by the lesions which have attacked it. In this
case one-half ounce doses of potassium nitrate or bicarbonate may be given
three times a day. Besides the constitutional treatment, it may be necessary to
give special attention to the bowels in order to relieve constipation. Cattle
may be given saline laxatives at the outset, such as 1 pound of Epsom salt for
an ordinary-sized cow, and the bowels kept regular by an occasional smaller
dose.</p>

<p>In chronic rheumatism the best course of treatment is to give
tonics and local treatment. Local treatment may also be advisable in acute
rheumatism in addition to the constitutional treatment already prescribed.</p>

<p>External treatment depends solely on the local conditions and should be
applied judiciously. Among the various remedies may be mentioned hot or cold
moist packs, hot air and vapor baths, friction, etc. Anodynes are often applied
locally with good results. Blisters are occasionally indicated. As anodynes may
be mentioned liniments and ointments containing salicylic acid or sodium
salicylate in combination with laudanum, aconite, or chloral hydrate.
Camphorated spirit, soap liniment, and essential oils also afford some relief
when applied locally. Of blisters, those containing cantharides are most
effective.</p>

<h2><a name="SURGICAL_OPERATIONS" id="SURGICAL_OPERATIONS"></a>SURGICAL
OPERATIONS.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">William Dickson</span> and <span
class="smcap">William Herbert Lowe, D. V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by B. T. Woodward, V. M. D.]</h5>

<p>Surgery is both a science and an art. The success of surgical operations
depends on the judgment, skill, and dexterity, as well as upon the knowledge of
the operator. The same fundamental principles underlie and govern animal and
human surgery, although their applications have a wide range and are very
different in many essential particulars. We must not lose sight of the fact
that hygiene and sanitation are essential to the best results in veterinary as
well as in human surgery.</p>

<p>Asepsis is an ideal condition which, although not always possible in animal
surgery, is highly important in connection with the mechanical details of all
surgical operations in proportion to the nature and seriousness of the same.</p>

<p>Aseptic surgery is considered to be the performance of operations with sterile
instruments with the hands of the operator and the site of operation being
rendered as nearly sterile as possible, and the wound treated during operation
with sterile solutions and protected following the operation with sterile
bandage material. In other words, it is the preservation of the highest degree
of cleanliness in connection with operations.</p>

<p>Local or general anesthesia should be resorted to in painful and serious
surgical operations, as operations upon all living creatures should be humanely
performed and all unnecessary pain and suffering avoided. Anesthesia is
necessary where absolute immobility of the patient is essential and where
entire muscular relaxation is indispensable. The anesthetic condition is also
favorable for the adjustment of displaced organs.</p>

<p>Large animals have to be cast and secured before an anesthetic is
administered. For complete anesthesia inhalations of chloroform are generally
employed; sometimes of both ether and chloroform. The quantity of chloroform
required to produce insensibility to external impressions varies much in
different cases and must be regulated, as well as the admixture of air, by a
competent assistant.</p>

<p>If the probability of the success of an operation is remote and the animal
is in healthy physical condition, so that its flesh is good for human food, it
is more advisable to butcher the animal than to <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>attempt a surgical operation
that offers little encouragement to the owner. The best judgment has to be
exercised in determining a matter of this kind, for no animal suffering from
inflammation or that is in a feverish condition is fit for human food.</p>

<p>All cases of major operative surgery require the skill and dexterity of the
experienced veterinary surgeon, and no one else should attempt such an
operation, for unnecessary suffering must be prevented. Nevertheless, the more
knowledge and understanding an owner of animals has of the principles of
surgical operations and manipulations, the better for all concerned. In the
first place, such an owner will appreciate more fully the skill of the
qualified veterinarian, and, in the second place, he will be the better
prepared and equipped to render assistance to his suffering dumb dependents
where no practitioner is accessible and in cases of emergency. There are,
moreover, some minor operations upon cattle, some of which can hardly be
classed as surgical, that the stockman and farmer should be able to perform
himself.</p>

<p>In the performance of any operation upon an animal of the size and strength
of the bull or cow, the first consideration is to secure the animal in such a
manner as to preclude the possibility of its injuring either itself or those
taking any part in the operation. The nature and time likely to be occupied by
an operation must, of course, largely determine the method to be adopted.</p>

<p>The majority of operations with which the present chapter is concerned are
usually performed on the animal in a standing position. A bull should always be
held by a staff attached to the ring in his nose. To secure the cow in a
standing position, grasp the nose, the finger and thumb being introduced into
the nostrils, and press against the cartilage which makes a division between
them. If she has horns, grasp one of them with the disengaged hand. If this is
insufficient the animal should be secured to a post, along the side of a fence,
or put into a stanchion. An excellent method of restraint is to tie a long rope
in a slip noose over the horns, pass it around the chest just behind the
forelegs, taking a half hitch on itself, taking another half hitch in front of
the hind limbs, passing the free end under the tail, bringing it forward and
making it fast either to the head or one of the hitches. The head should be
raised to the level of the back before the final knot is tied, so as to render
it too serious and painful a matter for her to repeat the first attempt she
makes to lower it. Should the nature or extent of the operation be likely to
take up considerable time, it is invariably the best plan to throw the animal.
In the case of the ox this is very easily done, either by use of horse hobbles,
should they be at hand, or by the application of a simple rope. If the horse
hobbles are used, they should be fastened on the <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>leg just above the fetlocks
(ankle joints), as in that position they are less liable to come off than if
placed around the pastern.</p>

<p>Of the many ways of applying the rope for this purpose we will describe only
two, which we consider the best and simplest:</p>

<p>First. Take a long, strong rope (one which has been used a few times is more
flexible), double it, and at 2 or 3 feet from the doubled end, according to the
size of the animal, make a knot and pass the collar thus formed over the
animal's head, allowing it to rest on what would be the collar place in a
horse. Now, pass the ends of the rope between the forelegs, carry one around
each hind leg just above the fetlock joint, from outside in, under itself once,
and bring the free ends forward, passing each through the collar loop on its
own side and bringing the slack back toward and beyond the hind quarters. (<a
href="#PLATE_XXVI">Pl. XXVI</a>, fig. 2.) Two or three men should then take
hold of each rope and at a given signal pull. The animal's hind legs being
drawn forward, the balance is lost, and if the animal does not fall or lie down
he can be readily pushed over on his side and secured in the desired
position.</p>

<p>Second. The three half hitches. Take a rope 30 or more feet long, make a
slip noose at the end and pass it over the animal's horns, leaving the knot in
the loop between the horns; then pass the rope backward along the neck to the
withers, just in front of which take a half hitch on it, passing it along the
back, take one half hitch just behind the forelegs and a second in front
of the hind limbs round the flank. (<a href="#PLATE_XXVI">Pl. XXVI</a>, fig.
1.) The free end of the rope is taken hold of by one or two assistants
while another holds the animal's head. By pulling firmly on the rope, or
inducing the animal to make a step or two forward while steady traction is made
on the rope, the beast will lie down, when his feet can be secured in the way
most convenient for the operator.</p>

<p>There are numerous other methods, involving more or less complete restraint,
which may be equally efficacious, but one or other of the ways indicated will
doubtless be found to meet fully all ordinary cases.</p>

<h4>RINGING THE BULL.</h4>

<p>This is usually and ought always to be done before the calf has attained
sufficient weight or strength to make his restraint a matter of serious
difficulty. An ordinary halter is usually all that is required, the strap being
secured to a tree or post. A jointed steel or copper ring is ordinarily used.
Those made of the latter metal are preferable.</p>

<p>The common method of punching a round piece out of the nasal septum for the
introduction of the ring is, I think, open to objection, as portions of the
fine nervous filaments are destroyed. The sensi<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>bility of the parts is thus
lessened and the object of ringing to some extent defeated. The insertion of
the ring by means of a trocar and cannula is preferable, as the method is not
open to this objection.</p>

<p>For some years we have used a little instrument, which can be made by any
worker in metal, consisting of a steel point riveted into a short cannula made
to fit on one end of the ring while open. (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>,
fig. 11.) When attached to the ring it is easily and quickly passed through
the septum, the half of the ring following as a matter of course. It can then
be removed and the ends of the ring brought together and fastened by means of
the screw for that purpose.</p>

<h4>DEHORNING.</h4>

<p>In the wild state the utility of the horns of cattle as weapons of offense
and defense is apparent, but with domestication of cattle and their confinement
the presence of horns constitutes a menace to the safety of their companions.
Horned cattle frequently inflict with their horns painful and serious injuries
to others. Deaths as a result of such injuries are not unusual. The operation
of dehorning would therefore be indicated as a matter of general safety.</p>

<p>On farms where breeding is conducted, the most desirable method is to
prevent the horns from growing on the young calves. This action results in a
more symmetrical appearance of the poll and eliminates the dangers which would
result from the presence of horns on the young cattle prior to their operative
removal at a later age. A calf should be treated not later than one week after
it is born&mdash;preferably when it is from 3 to 5 days old. The agent to be
used may be either caustic soda or potash in the form of sticks about the
thickness of an ordinary lead pencil. These caustics must be handled with care,
as they dissolve the cuticle and may make the hands or fingers sore. The
preparation of the calf first consists in clipping the hair from the parts,
washing clean with soap or warm water, and thoroughly drying with a cloth or
towel. The stick of caustic should be wrapped in a piece of paper to protect
the hands and fingers, leaving one end of the stick uncovered. Moisten the
uncovered end slightly and rub it on the horn buttons or little points which
may be felt on the calf's head&mdash;first on one, then on the other&mdash;two
or three times, allowing the caustic to dry after each application. Be careful
to apply the caustic to the horn button only, for if it is brought in contact
with the surrounding skin it will cause pain. Too much moisture on the stick of
caustic will allow the application to spread to the surrounding skin. After
treatment keep the calf protected from rain, as water on the head after
application of the caustic will cause it to run down over the face.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Dehorning of adult animals is usually performed after the age of 2 years, as
after that age there is less probability of the horns again growing. The horns
should be severed from the head from a quarter to a half-inch below where the
skin joins the base of the horn, cutting from the back toward the front if a
saw is used. If the horn is not cut close enough to the head, an irregular,
gnarly growth of horn is liable to follow.</p>

<p>Before attempting to dehorn the animal, it should be securely controlled by
ropes in a stanchion or by casting. Upon the range the cattle are usually
controlled by casting or by placing them in a "squeezer" connected with a
corral. A clean, sharp meat saw or a miter saw with a rigid back may be used.
Various types of dehorning shears or clippers are in general use. One type of
dehorner has a stationary knife edge with its cutting edge shaped like a very
wide V, and opposing this, another knife of similar shape moving in a slide, so
that the cutting edges act upon the horn from all four sides at once, all the
edges passing the center at the same time. Another type has a movable knife,
with one oblique or one curved edge, and the cutting is done in one direction
only. The power for cutting with these instruments is supplied by pulling
together two long handles which, in order to transmit a greater force, are
generally so constructed that they act through the medium of a series of cogs.
In dehorning with these instruments the cutting edges should be slipped down
over the horn and the knives closed, so that their edges set firmly against the
horn in such position that the cut will be made in the right place and in
the right direction. The handles should then be drawn together with a quick,
firm, strong pull so that the horn will be completely severed by the first act
and without twisting.</p>

<p>Dehorning should, when possible, be performed in cool weather when the flies
are not plentiful. The loss of blood from the operation is not sufficient, as a
rule, to be of consequence, and after care being taken to prevent substances
from getting into the openings left after the removal of the horns it is not
usual to apply any dressing. Pine tar or a mixture of pine tar and tannic acid
may be applied, particularly if the weather is warm.</p>

<h4>SETONING.</h4>

<p>The ordinary use of a seton is to keep up constant drainage from a cavity
containing matter or to act as a stimulant or counterirritant. To insert a
seton, the place of entrance and exit having been decided on, with the finger
and thumb make a small fold of the skin transversely to the direction the seton
is to be inserted, and cut it through, either with a sharp knife or a pair of
scissors (this should be done at both the entrance and exit); then with a
steady pressure and slight <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"
id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>lateral movement insert the seton by means of a
seton needle. (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, figs. 1 and 2.) The seton
should consist of a piece of strong tape, varying in breadth according to
circumstances, and should be kept in place either by a knot on each end or by
tying the ends together.</p>

<p>Setons should be gently moved once a day after suppuration is set up, and
they should not be allowed to remain in over three weeks, or a month at the
outside.</p>

<h4>TRACHEOTOMY.</h4>

<p>This operation consists in making an opening in the trachea, or windpipe. It
is indicated whenever there is an obstruction from any cause in the upper part
of the respiratory tract which threatens the death of the animal by asphyxia
(suffocation). The mode of procedure is as follows: Have an assistant extend
the animal's head as far as possible to make the trachea tense and prominent;
make a longitudinal incision about 2 to 2&frac12; inches long through the skin and
deeper tissues and trachea at the most prominent part of the trachea, which is
about the middle or upper third, and then insert the tracheotomy tube. The
latter should be removed once or twice daily and cleansed, and the wound
dressed antiseptically. To ascertain when it is time to discontinue the use of
the tube and to allow the wound to close, the hand should be held over the
opening, which will require the animal to use its natural passages in
breathing. Observe whether it is performed in a natural manner, and if so,
remove the tube and allow the wound to close. Often the operation has
to be performed in great haste without the proper instruments and under great
disadvantages, the operator having to cut down quickly, open the trachea and
spread the parts, using some instrument improvised by him at the time. This
operation only gives the animal relief in breathing, and therefore the proper
remedial treatment should be adopted at the onset of the attack and continued
until the cause (the disease) has been overcome.</p>

<h4>RUMENOTOMY.</h4>

<p>The opening of the paunch, or rumen, in cattle and the removal of a part or
the whole of the ingesta through said opening is termed rumenotomy. The
operation should be performed in severe cases only, where the rumen is
excessively overloaded and distended. The animal is placed with its right side
against a wall and firmly held in position by strong assistants. The incision
is made in the same place that the trocar is inserted for puncturing that organ
in cases of hoven. The opening is increased in size until the operator's hand
can be inserted into the rumen. Before any of the contents are removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>from
that organ a linen cloth should be placed from the outer wound into the rumen
in order to prevent any of the ingesta from getting into the abdominal cavity.
Some practitioners, after removing a portion of the contents of the rumen,
introduce such medicine as may be indicated before closing the wound. Clean the
wound and close the opening in the rumen with uninterrupted (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 8)
carbolized catgut sutures. Next close the external wound, consisting of the
integument, muscle, and peritoneum, with stout, interrupted (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 6)
metallic sutures. No feed should be given for several hours after the operation, and
then gruels only. (See "Distention of rumen or paunch with feed," <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>.)</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES.</h4>

<p>An abscess may be detected, if situated externally, by heat, pain, redness,
and swelling in the early stages, and, if further developed, by the fluctuation
which is present. When any of these symptoms are absent, the suppuration should
be encouraged by the means of hot fomentations and poultices. Care must be
taken that the abscess is not opened too soon, or to some extent it may cause
it to scatter, and the escape of pus will be lessened. The time to open an
abscess is just before it is ready to break, and should be done with a sharp
lance, a crucial incision sometimes being necessary. The cavity should be
syringed out with an antiseptic solution. Care should be taken not to allow the
wound to close too rapidly, to prevent which a tent of lint or oakum should be
introduced.</p>

<h4>WOUNDS.</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the present work wounds may be divided into three
classes: (1) Incised; (2) punctured; (3) lacerated or contused. In any wound
all that the most suitable applications can accomplish is, in the first place,
to prevent the access of those poisonous germs which exist in the animal's
surroundings, such as the soil and the manure, and, in the second place, when
the process of repair is for some reason temporarily inactive or altogether
arrested, to incite that curative inflammation that is the invariable method by
which the cure is effected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Incised wound</span>.&mdash;This is one with clean-cut
edges, and may be either superficial or deep. In wounds of all descriptions
there is necessarily more or less bleeding, and this is especially liable to be
the case in incised wounds, particularly when they penetrate to a considerable
depth, or when inflicted on a part where blood vessels of any considerable size
approach the surface. To arrest the hemorrhage must therefore be the first
consideration. If slight, a generous use of cold water is all that is
necessary, but if one or more vessels <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296"
id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>of any size have been wounded or entirely
severed, they should be taken up and ligated. If the blood flows continuously
and is dark in color, it proceeds from a vein, but if bright-colored and jerky
in its flow, it is arterial.</p>

<p>The taking up of an artery simply means the tying up of the bleeding vessel,
which should be accomplished as follows: To discover the bleeding artery take a
piece of clean absorbent cotton, dip it in cold water, and by gentle pressure
on the wound clear it of the accumulated blood. The jet of fresh blood reveals
the end of the vessel, which is readily recognized by its whitish-yellow or
buff color. It should be seized with a forceps or pincers and slightly drawn
clear of the surrounding tissues. Now take the thread and place the middle of
it under the artery, take up the ends, tie one simple knot tightly, pressing
the thread down with the forefinger so as not to include the forceps, then a
second one over it and cut off the ends. The bleeding being arrested, the
operator can now carefully clean and inspect the wound, taking care to remove
all blood and foreign matters and clip the hair around the edges before
proceeding to stitch it up. If the wound is superficial, the lips may be
brought together by a series of independent stitches (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 6)
about one-half of an inch to three-fourths of an inch apart. The stitches
should not be drawn tightly; it is sufficient to bring the edges of the wound
in apposition.</p>

<p>If the wound is deep, the needle should be introduced perpendicularly at as
great a distance from the lip of the wound as the depth it is to be inserted,
so as to give the thread sufficient hold. All the stitches should be as nearly
as possible at equal distances from the border of the wound, to prevent unequal
strain, and the knots should be made at the side, not over the wound. (<a
href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 6.) When the wound is large and deep,
care should be taken to have an opening in the lowest part to allow for the
escape of the discharges.</p>

<p>In deep wounds which run crosswise of a limb or muscle it is often advisable
to use what is technically known as the "quilled suture," which is most readily
understood by reference to <a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, figure 7.
To accomplish this method a curved needle with an eye in the point and a strong
double thread should be used. The needle thus threaded is introduced perpendicularly
at least an inch from the wound on one side, carried across below and brought out
the same distance from the border of the cut on the opposite side, the thread being
seized and held in position while the needle is withdrawn, leaving a loop of
thread protruding on one side and two loose ends on the other side of each
stitch. When enough stitches have been made, take a light piece of wood about
the size of a lead pencil, corresponding in length to the size of the wound or
slightly longer, and insert it through each of the loops, drawing up the free
ends of the threads, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">
[Pg 297]</a></span>which should in turn be tied securely on a similar piece
of wood on that side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Punctured wounds</span>.&mdash;Owing to the uncertainty
of their depth and the structures they may involve, punctured wounds are by far
the most dangerous and difficult to treat. Not only is the extent of the damage
hidden from view, but the very character of the injury, as can be readily
understood, implies at least the possibility of deep-seated inflammation and
consequent discharge of pus (matter), which, when formed, is kept pent up until
it has accumulated to such an extent that it burrows by simple gravity, as no
other exit is possible. In this way foreign matters, such as a broken piece of
the stake or snag, or whatever caused the wound, may be carried to an
indefinite depth, or the cavity of a joint may be invaded and very serious, if
not fatal, consequences occur.</p>

<p>The danger is especially marked when the injury is inflicted on parts liable
to frequent and extensive motion, but all cases of punctured wounds should
receive unusual care, as no judgment can be accurately formed from the external
appearance of the wound. While a probe can ascertain the depth, it throws but
little light on the extent or exact nature of the internal injury. For this
reason all punctured wounds should invariably be carefully searched by means of
a probe or some substitute devised for the occasion, such as a piece of wire
with a smooth blunt end, or a piece of hard wood shaped for the purpose.
Stitching is not admissible in the case of punctured wounds. After thoroughly
cleansing the opening of the wound and its surroundings, tincture of iodin
should be injected directly into the wound.</p>

<p>If a punctured wound is not very deep, and when the bruising and laceration
are slight, it is possible for healing to take place by adhesion, and this
should always be encouraged, as the process of repair by this method is far
superior to that by granulation, which will be referred to later. With this
object in view, the animal should be kept as quiet as possible. A dose of
physic, such as a pound of Glauber's or Epsom salt, should be administered, and
warm antiseptic fomentations or poultices, when this is practicable, applied
frequently to the surface of the wound.</p>

<p>In wounds of this description the process of repair may be complicated by
the appearance of exuberant granulations, popularly known as "proud flesh,"
which is really an overgrowth of new tissue&mdash;granulation tissue; but these
should not be interfered with unless they continue after the acute stage of
inflammation has been subdued. If, after this, they persist, they may be
treated with a 10 per cent solution of sulphate of copper (bluestone) or
nitrate of silver (lunar caustic) in water.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contused or lacerated wounds</span>.&mdash;These are
usually caused by a blow with some blunt instrument or by falls. The
seriousness depends largely on the depth of the injury, and treatment should be
directed to allaying the inflammation and preventing the consequent tendency to
sloughing. To this end soothing applications, such as antiseptic fomentations
and poultices, are plainly indicated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Methods of healing</span>.&mdash;Technically these may
be divided into a number of distinct processes, but practically we may speak of
them as two only, namely, by primary union, or adhesion, and by granulation. As
suppuration is not so liable to occur in cattle as in horses, healing by the
former and more speedy process is much more common in the first-named species,
more particularly in clean-cut or incised wounds, provided they have been
stitched within 12 hours from the time the injury which caused them was
inflicted, that they have been kept antiseptically clean, and that the patient
by some means has been kept fairly still. This latter stipulation is probably
hardest to comply with. Quiet is an important factor in the process of repair
among the lower animals.</p>

<p>The second method of healing, namely, by granulation, which is, however, the
manner in which most wounds in animals heal, takes much longer. In punctured
wounds of any depth healing necessarily takes place in this way only, and the
treatment should be directed largely to alleviating pain and moderating
inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After-treatment and dressing of wounds</span>.&mdash;The
dressing of wounds is one of the most important branches of veterinary surgery,
and one of the most constant difficulties that the practicing veterinarian has
to contend with lies in the lack of cooperation on the part of owners in the
care and attention in the after-treatment of wounds.</p>

<p>In summarizing the treatment of wounds, the following recommendations should
be observed: wounds must be cleansed and kept clean, using antiseptic solutions
which do not produce irritation, and applying the solutions with a syringe or
with clean pieces of absorbent cotton. Bleeding should be stopped before the
closing of the wound by sutures or bandages. An opening at the bottom of all
wounds except small superficial wounds should be provided as a drainage outlet
for the escape of wound secretions or pus if it should form. The edges of
wounds and the muscles involved in the wound should be kept as quiet as
possible during the process of healing. Every wound should be protected by a
sterile or antiseptic dressing whenever it is possible to retain a dressing in
place. Dressings should be changed when it is apparent that they have become
drenched with wound secretions or pus, or have become disarranged or too loose,
permitting dirt to enter between them and the skin. If swelling appears beyond
the edges of a bandage, it is an indication that it is too tight and it should
then be removed and again applied.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The hands of the operator and all instruments and dressings coming in
contact with a wound at any time should be made as clean as possible by the use
of antiseptics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbed-wire cuts</span>.&mdash;We have specified these
simply because in some sections of the country there is a fixed idea that there
is a specific poison in barbed wire, causing injuries which require treatment
differing from that which is applicable to ordinary wounds. Barbed-wire cuts
differ from ordinary wounds only in the parts being often lacerated and torn,
and the treatment already indicated for wounds of that description is
applicable to them.</p>

<h4>CASTRATION.</h4>

<p>Castration consists in the removal of the essential organs of generation,
and is performed upon both the male and the female. In the male the organs
removed are the testicles and in the female the ovaries.</p>

<h5>CASTRATION OF THE MALE.</h5>

<p>Castration in the male is performed for several different purposes. It may
be necessary, as is the case in certain diseased conditions of the testicles
and in strangulated hernia, but the usual object of the operation is to enhance
the general value of the animal. For example, if the animal is intended for
burden, the operation will better fit him for his work by so modifying his
temperament and physical condition that he may easily be controlled by his
master. Again, if he is merely to be used for beef purposes, the operation will
improve the quality of the flesh and cause an added development of the most
valuable portions of the dressed carcass.</p>

<p>The operation upon the female may be performed on account of diseased
conditions, but we may say that the chief object of the operation is to make
the animal one of more profit to its owner by lessening the lacteal secretion
and also improving the physical condition from the point of view of beef
production. When the cow is spayed, it does away with all trouble
attending estrum, or heat, gestation, and parturition with its accidents
and ailments. The flesh of the spayed cow is more tender and juicy than that of
the natural animal.</p>

<p>The operation upon the male may be either the uncovered or the covered. In
the former the incision is made down to the testicle proper, and in the
latter the cut is made through the scrotum or the outside covering and through
the dartos, or the next coat, care being taken to cut no deeper tissues or
coats. The age at which the operation is performed varies, but usually it is
performed between the second and third month. If done in early life, there is
less danger of complications, the organs being in a latent condition and not
fully developed. There are many different methods of operating, the principal
ones of which we shall mention. In the uncovered operation a <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>good free incision
should be made, exposing the testicle completely. Now it may be removed by
simply cutting it off. The only danger of doing this is that hemorrhage is
liable to follow. To obviate this, before the division of the spermatic cord it
should be twisted several times in the following manner: Take hold of the cord
with the left hand, having it between the thumb and the index finger. Now twist
the free portion several times with the right hand, all the time being careful
to push with the left hand toward the body of the animal. In this way the
danger of injury to the cord during the animal's struggles will be overcome.
There will be no hemorrhage, or very little, if it has been done properly. This
is the most simple manner of torsion. There are forceps and other instruments
made to perform the operation in this manner. The actual cautery is an old
method, but we shall not describe it, as we consider that we have better
methods now. The next method with the clamps, although extensively used upon
the horse, is not practiced to so great an extent upon the bovine at the
present time. It is a very old method, and is considered very safe. Clamps are
used in the covered and uncovered operations.</p>

<p>More modern methods are by the use of special instruments known as the
emasculator and the Ã©craseur.</p>

<p>The operation of "mulling" or crushing the spermatic cord is an unscientific
and barbarous procedure, causing unnecessary pain and suffering.</p>

<p>The methods described above apply only to the animal in a normal condition.
Before operating everything should be examined to see that it is as it should
be. If otherwise, a special operative procedure will be necessary. Whichever
mode of operation is adopted from a practical standpoint, the principal
precautions to be taken in order to attain success are as follows: First,
thorough cleanliness under strict aseptic and antiseptic precautions; second, a
free and boldly made incision; third, the avoidance of undue pulling or tension
upon the spermatic cord; fourth, free drainage, which can be maintained,
provided the original incision has been properly made.</p>

<p>The operation of castration of the male is by no means a serious one, and
when properly performed there is little danger from complications. Although the
danger is trifling, the complications which may arise are sometimes of a
serious nature. Hemorrhage, either primary or secondary, tetanus (or lockjaw),
abscesses, hernia (or rupture), gangrene, and peritonitis are the most serious
complications that follow castration. Whichever complication arises will
require its own special treatment, which we will not go into here, as it will
be fully dealt with under another heading. We would add, however, that,
generally speaking, the animal, after being castrated, should either be
regularly exercised or be allowed freedom so that it can <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>exercise itself.
Sudden changes of the temperature are dangerous. The animal should be fed
moderately, but of a diet easily digestible.</p>

<h5>CASTRATION OF THE FEMALE.</h5>

<p>The operation of ovariotomy (spaying) should be performed when the heifer is
in her prime and in moderate condition not too plethoric and not in heat or
pregnant. This operation may be performed in one of two ways&mdash;namely, by
the flank or by the vagina&mdash;each operation having its special advantages.
In the flank operation the animal may be operated upon either while standing or
while in the recumbent position. If standing, she should be placed against a
wall or a partition and her head held by a strong assistant. The legs also must
be secured to prevent the animal from kicking. A vertical incision should be
made in the left flank, about the middle of the upper portion, care being taken
not to make the opening too far down, in order to avoid the division of the
circumflex artery which traverses that region. The operator should now make an
opening through the peritoneum, which is best done with the fingers. Next the
hand and arm should be introduced into the abdominal cavity and the hand
directed backward toward the pelvis, searching for the horns of the uterus; if
followed up the ovaries will easily be found. They should then be drawn outward
and may be removed either by the Ã©craseur or by torsion. Closing and suturing
the wound will complete the operation. An adhesive plaster bandage can be
beneficially applied.</p>

<p>The operation by the vagina is more complicated and requires special and
expensive instruments. The mode of procedure in brief is as follows: A speculum
is introduced into the vagina, and an incision is made into the superior wall
of that passage about 2 inches from the neck of the uterus, cutting from below
upward and from before backward. An incision which should not exceed 3&frac12;
inches in length should be made. The next step is to get possession of the
ovaries. They are situated in a fold of the broad ligament and should be drawn
carefully through the incision into the vagina. Now take the long-handled
scissors, specially made for this purpose, with which the thick border of the
broad ligament is divided. The torsion forceps are introduced and applied to
the broad ligament above the ovary. The left hand is then introduced, and the
thumb and the index finger grasp hold of the broad ligament above the forceps.
With the right hand torsion is applied and the ovary removed. The other ovary
may be removed in the same manner.</p>

<p>What has been said with regard to complications and aftertreatment in the
case of the male also applies to the female.</p>

<h2><a name="TUMORS_AFFECTING_CATTLE" id="TUMORS_AFFECTING_CATTLE"></a>TUMORS AFFECTING CATTLE.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">John R. Mohler, V. M. D.</span>,</h3>

<h5><em>Chief, Bureau of Animal Industry</em>.</h5>

<p><span style="font-size: smaller">[<em>Synonyms</em>: New growth, neoplasm,
neoformation, pseudoplasm, swelling, and hyperplasia.]</span></p>

<p><em>Definition</em>.&mdash;Tumors<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are abnormal masses of tissue,
noninflammatory and independent in character, arising, without obvious cause,
from cells of preexistent tissue, possessing no physiologic function, and
characteristically unrestrained in growth and structure.</p>

<p>Tumors are abnormal masses of tissue. The application of the term "tumor" is
directly connected with the fact that they produce local enlargement.</p>

<p>They are noninflammatory; that is, the process of inflammation is not
directly the cause or accompaniment of them. An inflammatory new growth tends
to disappear upon the subsidence of the inflammatory process, while spontaneous
disappearance of a tumor is comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Tumors are independent. For instance, their nutrition bears no relation to
the nutrition of the body. A lipoma, or fatty tumor, in the subcutaneous
tissue, may go on increasing to huge bulk while the body is steadily
emaciating. Again, the tissues of the aged gradually undergo atrophy, yet
cancers arise at this time and grow rapidly.</p>

<p>Tumors are unrestrained in growth and structure. In the development of an
animal we know at what period of its existence the mass of tissue called liver
will develop&mdash;what its site, structure, and size will be. We know that it
will remain only in that locality, and not, as it were, colonize throughout the
system. With tumors it is different; there are no laws by which we can forecast
the time, place, nature, or size of development of them. There is no cartilage
in the kidney or parotid gland, yet a chondroma, or cartilage tumor, may
develop in either. Even when a new growth of tissue is started by <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>an injury and
consequent inflammation&mdash;as, for instance, proud flesh&mdash;there is a
limitation of its size, but the controlling influences which govern the size of
an organ or normal mass of tissue and limit the extent of an inflammatory
overgrowth are all absent in the case of tumors. They are unrestrained,
lawless.</p>

<p>Metastasis expresses the lawlessness of tumors as regards being limited to
the original site of development. Small particles of tumors enter the blood
vessels or lymph streams and are carried to distant parts of the body, where
they lodge and start new tumor formations. Expansion by colonization in this
manner is a rule with many tumors, and, since they exercise no function of use
to the organism, this dissemination of actively growing particles becomes a
menace to the system by numerically increasing the body's burden, opening new
channels of drain upon the system and adding new centers for the absorption of
putrefactive materials when the secondary tumors shall have degenerated. It is
this which makes metastasis such an important element in the malignancy of
tumors.</p>

<p>Tumors possess no physiological function. They are absolutely useless.
Fibrous tumors bind no parts of the organism together; bony tumors add nothing
to the supporting framework of the body; the tissue of fatty tumors never
serves as a storehouse of feed and energy; the cells of an adenoma, or gland
tumor, furnish no secretion; a tumor composed of muscle tissue produces no
increase to the strength of the individual&mdash;its muscle cells are not
contractile.</p>

<p>Tumors arise from cells of preexistent tissue. Tumor tissue is not a new
variety. Whatever the structure of a tumor, its counterpart is found among the
tissues of the body, the lawlessness of the tumor, however, showing itself in
more or less departure from the normal type. This departure is usually a
reversion to a more elementary or embryonic stage, so that the tumor tissues
may be said to be structurally immature.</p>

<p>Tumors arise without obvious cause. Concerning the ultimate cause of tumor
formation we are absolutely ignorant. Various theories have been advanced from
time to time, but none of them have been applicable to more than a limited
number of cases. The most important theories may be briefly mentioned.</p>

<p>(1) <em>The theory of tumor diathesis</em>.&mdash;Bilroth taught that tumors are
caused by a peculiar predisposition consisting of a diseased state of the
fluids of the body. This constitutional taint might be acquired, but, having
been acquired, is also hereditary. This theory is known also as the heredity
hypothesis, but, while it is true that heredity appears to play some role in
the causation of certain neoplasms, its application is too limited to make it
of value.</p>

<p>(2) <em>The mechanical or irritant theory</em>.&mdash;Virchow assumed that tumors
arise as the result of previous irritation of the part. This <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>has been noticed
particularly in the case of certain cancers. They frequently develop on the
edges of old ulcers, thus being dependent apparently on chronic irritation.
Cancer of the lip in pipe smokers is a case in point. Cancerous tumors of the
skin often develop on the arms of workers in paraffin, tar, or soot, the
chemical irritation of these substances being the cause. On the
contrary, the proportion of those thus affected among the exposed is very small
and forces the conclusion that if the real cause were in the irritation vastly
more cases would occur.</p>

<p>(3) <em>The theory of nervous influence</em>.&mdash;That is based upon (a) the
observed fact that tumors occur more frequently in man and the higher animals
than in those lower in the scale, among which the nervous system is less highly
developed; (b) that certain formations seem to be directly connected with nerve
distribution, while others have been associated with alternations in
neighboring nerve trunks.</p>

<p>(4) <em>The embryonal theory</em>.&mdash;This is known also as Cohnheim's hypothesis.
In early fetal life there occurs a production of cells in excess of those
required for the construction of the various parts of the body, so that a
certain number of them are left over in the fully developed tissue or become
misplaced during the sorting of cells for future development of tissues and
organs. These cells lie dormant until favorable conditions arise or until some
sufficient stimulus is applied, when, released from their inactivity, they
begin to reproduce and grow. Not being normally related to their site, they
lack the controlling and limiting influences of the part, and, their embryonic
character enduing them with a most potent proliferating power, they develop in
a lawless and unrestrained manner. There are tumors whose existence can be
explained only on these grounds. Still, this theory falls far short of
answering the question as to the origin of tumors.</p>

<p>(5) <em>The parasitic theory</em>.&mdash;This is not only one of the latest, but,
merely as a hypothesis, it is the most attractive and plausible of all. The
serious objections to it, however, are the almost uniform failure that has met
the attempts to transplant these tumors from one animal to another and the
absence of any constant variety of organism in them. Several forms of parasites
have been found in certain tumors, but nothing definite has been shown with
reference to the relation they bear to the causation of the neoplasm.</p>

<h4>CLASSIFICATION OF TUMORS.</h4>

<p>In Senn's work on tumors occurs the following: "A uniform system of
classification of tumors is one of the great wants of modern pathology, and all
attempts in this direction have proved failures." It would be folly, therefore,
to burden the pages of a work of this kind with one or several of the proposed
systems which have, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a>
</span>admittedly, at some important point, failed of their purpose. Since
the value of this chapter depends chiefly upon its practical character, which
in turn is measured by its aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, the old
but important clinical division is here adopted.</p>

<p>Tumors are either malignant or benign. The essential difference between the
two classes is that while <em>benign tumors depend for their ill effects entirely
upon their situation, malignant neoplasms wherever located inevitably destroy
life</em>. The clinical features of each group are in many cases sufficiently marked
to distinguish them.</p>

<div class="left" style="margin: 2.5% 20% 2.5% 20%;">

<h5>MALIGNANT TUMORS.</h5>

<p>(1) These are invariably pernicious, and from the beginning tend to destroy
life.</p>

<p>(2) The cellular element predominates; therefore they grow rapidly.</p>

<p>(3) Possessing no capsule, they infiltrate surrounding tissues.</p>

<p>(4) They infect adjacent lymph glands.</p>

<p>(5) They recur even after complete removal.</p>

<p>(6) They give metastasis; that is, they become disseminated in different
organs.</p>

<p>(7) Their presence develops a progressive emaciation.</p>

<h5>BENIGN TUMORS.</h5>

<p>(1) These in and of themselves do not tend to produce death.</p>

<p>(2) As the cellular element is not liable to predominate, they grow
slowly.</p>

<p>(3) They are encapsulated, and when diffuse do not infiltrate surrounding
tissues.</p>

<p>(4) They do not infect adjacent lymph glands.</p>

<p>(5) They do not recur after complete removal.</p>

<p>(6) They do not manifest metastasis.</p>

</div>

<p>Benign tumors, though harmless, may, by the accident of their location,
indirectly produce death. Mere pressure on the brain substance of an otherwise
innocent tumor, compression of the blood supply for vital organs, growth in
such manner as to cause obstruction in the alimentary tract or pressure upon
nerves, may cause death, or, prior to death, so combine the effects of anemia
(deficiency of blood), starvation, and pain, with its consequent restlessness,
as to produce a veritable cachexia (condition of general ill health).</p>

<p>On the other hand, a malignant tumor in its primary growth may so implicate
a vital organ as to destroy life before metastasis can occur or even before
cachexia can develop. Thus, to the untrained observer, environment may so
operate as to cause these two classes of new growths to simulate each other.
The boundary lines may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">
[Pg 307]</a></span>seem to overlap. It is here that the microscope, as the
court of last appeal, adjudicates positively in the diagnosis between these two
clearly marked divisions.</p>

<p>It may almost be asserted that a true classification of tumors can not be
made until we know more about the cause of them. The arrangement here presented
is offered to meet the practical needs of the veterinarian, student, and farmer
rather than of the pathologist.</p>

<p>We may roughly divide the tissues of the body into structural and lining
tissues. The structural tissues are composed of the tissues of special function
and simple connective tissues. The lining or covering tissues, both internal
and external, are known as epithelium.</p>

<p>Section A of the table below contains the true tumors or proper
neoplasms.</p>

<p>Section B includes the cysts, some of which are true tumors, while others
are false ones, but the latter are added because of their gross resemblance to
the true and the consequent necessity of considering them at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terminology</span>.&mdash;The principle of naming tumors
is quite simple. The Greek word "oma" (plural "omata") means tumor. This word
"oma" is added to the stem of the word ordinarily used to designate the kind of
tissue of which the tumor is composed. Thus a tumor formed after the type of
fibrous tissue is a fibroma. The only exception to this is in the naming of the
two large classes of malignant neoplasms. There the names were formed from the
fleshlike appearance of the one and the crablike proliferations of the
other&mdash;namely, Sarcoma (sarks=flesh), carcinoma (karkinos=crab).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diagnosis</span>.&mdash;In the diagnosis of tumors note
is taken of (1) clinical history and (2) examination of the tumor.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Clinical history</em>.&mdash;Circumstances connected with the origin of the
tumor and its rapidity of growth may point to an inflammatory swelling rather
than a tumor. The location of the tumor at its commencement is important, as,
for instance, in diagnosing between lipoma and carcinoma, the former being more
or less movable under the skin, while a carcinoma develops in the skin. While
tenderness on pressure may be caused by compression of a sensitive nerve by a
tumor or by tumors of the nerve or nerve sheaths, as a rule this symptom is
indicative of inflammatory swelling rather than of the existence of a tumor.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Direct examination of the tumor</em>.&mdash;In the application of this
diagnosis the trained observer will note color, size, shape, and surface
structure, transmission of light, movableness, consistence, resistance,
pulsation, and crepitation. Percussion, auscultation, and exploration are also
available methods. Finally, microscopic examination of the growing portions of
the tumor by a pathologist will be found most satisfactory.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>GENERAL TREATMENT OF TUMORS.</h4>

<p>For benign tumors treatment is required only when it damages the animal's
value or when merely for sake of appearance. When it is possible, the removal
of the tumor by an operation is indicated. If the tumor has a small,
constricted base, remove by torsion, ligation, or with an Ã©craseur. Ligation
following the incision of the skin with a knife avoids the pain of pressing on
the sensitive nerves of the skin and is suitable for tumors of broad base and
small bodies. A firing iron, such as is used in line or feather firing, may
also be used in removing tumors with small attachments. This not only stops the
bleeding but forms a firm scab, under which healing may occur rapidly. Those
tumors that can not be removed by the above methods may be treated with caustics or
acids, such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic potash, arsenic,
silver nitrate, or chromic acid, but it is difficult to limit the action of
these drugs. The injection, into the tumor, of such chemicals as anilin dyes,
alcohol, acetic acid, citric acid, or ergotin, is of doubtful value, as is also
the injection of the germs of erysipelas&mdash;thought by some to be a
specific. Certain specific tumors, such as actinomycosis and botryomycosis, may
be successfully treated by the internal administration of potassium iodid,
together with the injection into the tumor or the painting of its surface with
either Lugol's solution or the tincture of iodin. The most reliable means of
treating tumors is by extirpation with cutting instruments. Dissect the tumor
from the surrounding tissue, ligating all the larger blood vessels, and tearing
the tissues with the fingers rather than cutting with a knife. The bleeding may
be stopped with a hot iron. The after treatment is the same as for any ordinary
wound of similar size.</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL TUMORS.</h4>

<p>Although a full list of the tumors that may be found in bovines has been
given above, there are a number that warrant a detailed description, and the
following mention will be made of the most important of them:</p>

<h5>MYOMA.</h5>

<p>These tumors are after the type of muscle. They are sharply circumscribed
and, as a rule, are very hard, a condition owing usually to combination with
fibroma and are then known as fibromyoma. In fact, the clinical differentiation
between myoma and fibroma is almost impossible. Myomas are found in the uterus,
vagina, stomach, intestines, gullet, and bladder of a bovine animal. They grow
very large, but, as a rule, are benign. Treatment should consist of their
removal.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
</p>

<h5>NEUROFIBROMA.</h5>

<p>A true neuroma built up of nerve fibers and nerve cells is infrequent, if it
ever occurs, in cattle. False neuromas, or neurofibromas, are knotty, spreading
tumors of the size of a large potato, which are developed within the nerve
sheaths and composed of nerve fibers and connective tissue bands interlaced.
The commingling of these varied fibers is often so intricate that separation is
practically impossible. This tumor is most frequently found upon the shoulder
of cattle. Treatment is surgical.</p>

<h5>ANGIOMA.</h5>

<p>The angiomas are tumors composed mainly of blood vessels or blood spaces and
are observed on the skin of man, where they are called "birthmarks" or
"mother marks." Cavernous angiomas are seen in cattle, affecting the liver and
the mucous membrane of the nasal septum. In the liver they appear as smooth,
flat, nonprojecting tumors of a dark-red or purple color and of about the size
of a silver 10-cent piece. They are somewhat softer in consistency than the
adjoining liver substance into which they are gradually fused. These tumors are
frequently observed by meat inspectors in livers of slaughtered cattle.
Treatment of angioma is unnecessary.</p>

<h5>ADENOMA.</h5>

<p>The structure of this tumor is after the type of gland tissue. It is rarely
seen in cattle except in combination with cancer or sarcoma. A growth which
occurs more frequently in bovines, especially calves, and which in some
instances bears a striking resemblance to an adenoma is the so-called
goiter.</p>

<h5>GOITER (STRUMA).</h5>

<p>This is a noninflammatory enlargement or a hyperplasia of the thyroid gland.
While it can not be definitely classed among tumors, yet, owing to its
resemblance to the latter, it will be discussed at this time. The cause of
goiter has never been definitely ascertained. Among the most probable causes
may be mentioned heredity, insufficient and improper diet, close confinement,
unhygienic surroundings, and an unknown toxic substance which is supposed to
obtain in those localities rich in magnesium and lime salts. Certain organisms
found in goiter have been suspected of producing this trouble, but their
relation to the disease has not been satisfactorily proved. A goiter may
consist of (1) simple enlargement of the follicles which are filled with
albuminous matter (follicular goiter); (2) an increase of connective tissues
between the follicles, causing the swelling to be dense and resistant (fibrous
goiter); (3) a great increase in size of one or more follicles, forming a cyst
(cystic goiter); (4) great dilatation of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311"
id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>the blood vessels in the gland accompanied with
pulsation with each heart beat (vascular goiter).</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Goiter may be observed at the side of the throat, reaching
the size of a fist or even larger, or it may hang down below the windpipe. In
cattle the two thyroid glands are close together, and when the disease affects
both there may be but one uniform swelling placed in front of the windpipe
below the angle of the jaw. This swelling may be hard, soft, or doughy in
consistence, and with each beat of the heart it may pulsate like an artery. It
may cause labored breathing by pressure on the windpipe, and death may result
from pressure on this structure, on the gullet, or on the adjoining large
vessels.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In young animals the treatment is usually satisfactory, and
consists in giving the animal a complete change of feed and plenty of exercise
in the open air. If the condition appears enzootic in the district, remove the
animal to another location when possible. Iodin, either in the form of ointment
or the tincture, should be applied to the swelling. Injections of iodin
solution, 5 grains of iodin in 1 dram of 25 per cent alcohol, may also be made
into the substance of the gland. When the swelling which follows this injection
has subsided it may be repeated. Potassium iodid should be given internally in
1&frac12; dram doses twice daily for a cow, or in 20-grain doses twice a day for a
calf. Extirpation of all but a small section of the swelling may be
successfully accomplished by a qualified veterinarian, but if it should be
entirely removed, myxedema and death follow.</p>

<h5>FIBROMA.</h5>

<p>Fibromas are tumors made up chiefly of connective tissue and are usually
confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Indurative fibromas of the skin
appear as tumors of gelatinous connective tissue or as firm, white vascular
connective tissue growths, which are more or less sharply outlined, move
readily over the underlying tissues in company with the skin, and owe their
origin to mechanical injuries, perforating wounds, repeated abrasions, or the
invasion of pus cocci or botryomyces into the tissues.</p>

<p>These tumors in cattle are frequently found upon the dewlap as solid lumps,
hard as stone to the touch, lying loosely between the layers of skin, and
gradually losing themselves in the softer tissues of the neck above, or as
smooth, hard tumors of glistening white substance with interlacing lines of
softer tissue. They may also be found in the region of the knee or at the
elbow. The skin over the growths, in accordance with the originating cause,
will be found chafed, covered with scabs, or even ulcerated and accompanied
with collateral edema.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
</p>

<p>These connective tissue tumors grow slowly but reach enormous size. They
sometimes follow injuries to the region of the throat and form there as hard,
firm growth, even reaching the size of a child's head.</p>

<p>A fibroma upon the larynx is not an infrequent occurrence in the ox. These
tumors are always sharply outlined and have a roughened surface. They may be
differentiated from actinomycotic tumors (see chapter on "Infectious diseases
of cattle," <a href="#Page_358">p. 358</a>) in the same location by their firm, fibrous structure and
by the absence of pus from the interior.</p>

<p>A tumor is sometimes seen upon the muzzle of cattle, which assumes a
diameter equaling the width of the muzzle. It is a voluminous connective-tissue
formation known by the name of "fibroma diffusum."</p>

<p>Another form is sometimes observed upon the tongue. It grows upon a broad,
spreading base, becoming very hard. It is almost lacking in blood vessels,
although the few that are present are plainly in view, and in consequence is
poorly supplied with fluids. It is of a smooth contour, white or whitish yellow
in color, is sharply limited from the normal substance of the tongue, may be
covered with mucous membrane, on which prominent papillÃ¦ are located, or only
by a thin, delicate layer of epithelium, and is usually found in the middle
part of the tongue, where it may reach the size of two fists.</p>

<p>Pedunculate or stemmed fibrous tumors are frequently noticed growing upon or
near the extremity of the tails of cows. They are apparently of traumatic
origin, such as tying the tail fast while milking or shaving it too closely
while trimming for show purposes, and usually contain bloody or gelatinous
material within, or, again, they may be strongly edematous throughout.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment of large fibromas is surgical and consists of
the operative removal of the tumor, followed by suturing of the wound. Small
external tumors may be painted with zinc chlorid, chromic acid, or a
concentrated solution of bichlorid of mercury.</p>

<h5>PAPILLOMA (WART).</h5>

<p>When fibromas develop from the lining or covering tissues they frequently
form papillary growths, more or less thickly covered with epithelium, and are
then called papillomas, or warts.</p>

<p>Papillomas consist of villouslike projections, resulting from a
proliferation of the outer layer (epithelium) of the skin or mucous membrane.
These growths are also called "angle berries," and may assume a variety of
forms. Sometimes there is a preponderance of epidermis in the formation, and
the tumor then appears as a hard, dense, insensitive, clublike growth, or wart.
Again the swelling is chiefly in the derm, or true skin, and we have what is
known as a flesh wart (verucca carnea). In other cases the growth of papillar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
bodies projects in great cauliflowerlike tumors with deeply furrowed and
lobulated surface, over which a covering of epidermis may or may not be
present. These are usually much softer and are well supplied with blood
vessels. It is not uncommon for them to be pedunculate or stemmed, and in this
case considerable rotary motion or twisting is possible. Their color is cloudy
gray or grayish red, with white bands of connective tissue radiating from the
center. Their consistence varies. Upon their surfaces and within their clefts
and fissures they undergo retrogressive changes, softening, bleeding, or
ulcerations.</p>

<p>A favorite location for the papilloma in cattle is the udder and teats,
where they may develop in such numbers as to cover the entire surface and make
the animal troublesome to milk. The sides of the head, neck, and
shoulders also afford satisfactory conditions for their growth, and are
frequently seen to be affected by them.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Warts may be removed with the scissors, twisted off with
the fingers, or ligatured by means of a rubber band or horsehair. The roots
should then be cauterized with tincture of iron, glacial acetic acid, or lunar
caustic. Acids should never be used in removing warts about the eyes or in the
mouth. Papillomas of the eyelids sometimes change to cancers and should be
removed by taking out a wedge-shaped section of the eyelid. Young cattle should
be given arsenic internally in the form of Fowler's solution, 1 tablespoonful
twice a day for a 6-months-old calf.</p>

<h5>POLYPS.</h5>

<p>Polyps are usually fibromas or myxomas, occurring on the mucous membrane of
the nasal passages or genital tract. They grow upon a narrow stem, bleed
readily when injured, and often contain a center of thin, limpid fluid. A
bloody discharge is sometimes seen coming from the affected nostril, but this
is not always easy of detection in cattle, owing to the pliancy of their
tongues and to their habit of licking an irritated nostril. Usually these
tumors grow downward and may project from the nostril, causing snoring sounds
and uneasy breathing. They may occasionally force themselves backward into the
throat, where they interfere seriously with respiration, the patient being
obliged to breathe with an effort, and even forced to cough in order to
dislodge temporarily the obstruction from the larynx. Such tumors, when near
the nostril, may easily be removed by the use of forceps or a loop made of
bailing wire. Serious bleeding is not liable to follow their removal, but an
astringent wash, such as a solution of the perchlorid of iron, if applied to
the cut surface, will be found very beneficial. In case the tumor is not within
easy reach, the services of a qualified veterinarian should be obtained to
perform the necessary operation.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
</p>

<h5>LIPOMA.</h5>

<p>This is a tumor consisting chiefly of fat cells. The growth is irregularly
rounded and distinctly lobulated, very soft, and almost fluctuating. It is
insensitive, grows slowly, and is always inclosed in a distinct fibrous
capsule, from which it can be easily shelled out. It may become very large and
often hangs pendulous from a long, elastic pedicle. In cattle this tumor may be
found in the subcutaneous tissues, especially of the back and shoulders,
uterus, and intestines, and in the latter position it may cause strangulation,
or "gut tie," by winding around a loop of the intestine.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When found on the skin the tumor may be readily removed
with a knife or by a ligature. Caustics and the cautery produce wounds that heal
slowly and can not be recommended in the treatment of this tumor.</p>

<h5>CHONDROMA.</h5>

<p>This tumor formation is composed of cartilage cells. It is a rounded and
very often unevenly nodular and sharply described tumor. It is very hard,
dense, elastic, and painless and develops principally where we find normal
cartilage cells. It is rare in cattle, but has been found in the subcutaneous
tissues and nasal cavities.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Extirpation.</p>

<h5>OSTEOMA (BONY TUMOR).</h5>

<p>Bones may occasionally grow in such a profuse and irregular manner that the
product, or osteophyte, assumes the character of a tumor. The bone tissue may
possess either spongy or compact properties and grow either from the periphery
of the bone or within its interior. These tumors most frequently appear about
the head of the animal, either upon the jawbones, within the nasal passages, or
in connection with the horns. They are usually of bony hardness, painless,
benign, and sharply outlined.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment consists in either removing them with a saw,
chisel, or trephine, or preventing their further development by
counterirritation with blisters or firing iron.</p>

<h5>MYXOMA.</h5>

<p>Characteristic myxomas are mucoid tumors which chiefly originate from the
mucous membrane and are especially to be found within the nasal passages and
uteri of cattle. They can reach a size of three fists, are smooth or
velvetlike, or may be lobulated, broad at the base, and consist of a
glassy-looking mass of connective tissue, which usually shows a distinctive
yellowish color. Being homogeneous and elastic, the moist, jellylike tissue
composing the tumor may be easily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315"
id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>destroyed or crushed. When cut through, these
tumors soon collapse from the loss of their fluids. They sometimes inclose
elliptical cavities filled with slimy, gelatinous masses.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Extirpation.</p>

<h5>SARCOMA.</h5>

<p>This is a malignant tumor after the type of embryonal tissue, and consists
of several varieties, such as the round cell, spindle cell, giant cell,
alveolar, and melanosarcoma. They grow by preference in connective tissue and
are quite vascular. Sarcomas appear either as single or multiple nodules,
varying in size from a hempseed to a hazelnut, or else as a moderate number of
tumors of the size of hen eggs. Their surface, at first smooth, later becomes
lumpy and tuberous from internal degeneration. Secondary nodules may appear
near the primary tumor. The outer skin is not involved so soon as in cancer,
nor does ulceration follow so rapidly. Sarcoma is about the most frequent and
dangerous tumor that is found in cattle. It occurs in young animals, and is
found on the serous membranes, in the glandular organs, and on the outer skin,
especially of the neck and shoulders&mdash;in fact, in nearly every tissue and
in almost every part of the body. This tumor is often found in places exposed
to traumatisms and at seats of scars, or of irritations from pressure and
inflammation.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment should consist in early and complete removal by
the knife, including one-half or three-quarters of an inch of the sound tissue
adjoining the tumor. If there is a possibility that sarcomatous tissue still
remains, either cauterize the wound with a hot iron or powder the walls of the
cavity with arsenious acid.</p>

<h5>CANCER (CARCINOMA).</h5>

<p>Cancers are tumors of epithelial tissues and are malignant. There are
several varieties of cancers, such as hard, soft, and colloid, but only those
growing on the surface will be mentioned here. These malignant tumors of the
superficial organs develop primarily from the epidermis or from the glands of
the skin. They appear secondarily as spreading infections from milk glands,
thyroids, anal glands, or as embolisms. In such cases their sole character
depends wholly upon the kind of cancer from which they have sprung. The
infiltrating cancer begins as an elevation of the skin, which progresses until
it becomes rough and nodular. The surface later becomes attacked, and an ulcer
results whose edges are outlined by a hard, firm zone.</p>

<p>The ulcerations may remain limited by cicatricial tissue, but it is more
likely that the infiltration and destruction of tissue will spread out wider
and deeper until a rodent ulcer (so called) is formed. One of the most frequent
sites of cancer in cattle is in the eye, where <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>they are called fungus
hematodes, but they also occur on the skin, on the genitals, in the stomach,
and within the organs.</p>

<p><em>Fungus hematodes</em>.&mdash;This starts at the inner corner of the eye as a
papillary elevation or as small nodules which become fused. They grow larger
and become papillomatous, with superficial ulcerations and a tendency toward
hemorrhage. In some cases the eye is displaced by the growing tumor or is
attacked by the cancer cells and entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>Cancerous growths upon the external genitals and the anus usually present a
rough, irregular surface from which there is a constant sloughing of decomposed
tissue accompanied with a penetrating disagreeable odor.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of cancer may be made clinically by noting the simultaneous
infection of the lymph glands which surround the primary lesion. Deeply
burrowing and infiltrating forms which appear as lumps and ulcerations cause
marked disfiguration of the affected part. The surface becomes a soft, greasy
mass; later it cracks open and from the fissures blood-colored pus exudes,
being continually formed by the moist degeneration of the tissues beneath. At
first the general health of the animal does not appear affected, but later the
cancer nodules spread to important organs and give rise to marasmus and
progressive emaciation. Cancer is not a frequent tumor of cows. FrÃ¶hner states
that of 75 cases of tumors in cattle which came under his observation 2, or 2.6
per cent, were found to be cancers, while 20, or 26.6 per cent, were
sarcomas.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in the early and complete removal of the
tumor, taking care to include a wide border of healthy tissue. This has been
most successful in such superficial cancers as those of the eye, penis, anus,
testicle, vulva, and sheath. If the disease has advanced too far, this
treatment may not prove efficacious, owing to the great malignancy of the
cancer and its tendency to recur. In such cases the animal may be slaughtered,
but the flesh should be used for food only after inspection by a competent
veterinarian.</p>

<h4>CYSTS.</h4>

<p>Cysts may be true or false tumors and consist of a capsule containing a
fluid or semisolid content. Among the most important cysts, which have been
briefly referred to in a previous table, the following are probably the most
noteworthy, owing to the frequency with which they are found in bovines:</p>

<h5>SOFTENING CYSTS.</h5>

<p>Softening cysts, which result from the degenerative liquefaction of normal
or diseased tissues, especially of tumors of different kinds, followed by the
encapsulation of the fluid.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
</p>

<h5>PARASITIC CYSTS.</h5>

<p>Parasitic or foreign-body cysts, from the inflammatory reaction induced by
such parasites as the echinococcus (hydatid cyst) or by the presence of various
kinds of foreign bodies.</p>

<h5>EXTRAVASATION CYSTS.</h5>

<p>Extravasation cysts, caused by injuries which rupture blood vessels,
followed by an increase of fibrous tissue which forms a capsule about the
fluid. The hygromata in front of the knee in cattle, so-called tumor of the
knee, and serous cysts belong to this variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hygromata, or tumors of the knee</span>.&mdash;These
consist in the simplest form of a collection of serous fluid mixed with
fibrin within a distended bursa. The walls surrounding the fluid become firm,
smooth, and dense.</p>

<p>Outwardly the tumor appears fluctuating, though tense, while the skin which
covers it may be normal, denuded of hair, or covered with hard epidermal
scales, possibly half an inch in thickness, forming a hard, horny plate. The
cavity which contains the fluid may have the dimensions of a hen's egg, an
apple, or a child's head. Its walls are formed by the diseased secreting
membrane of the bursal sac, and are readily detachable from the subcutis of the
skin. Their internal surfaces are often uneven or supplied with projections or
tufted growths which support a fibrous network within the tumor.</p>

<p>Tumors of the knee may also assume a granular type, as the result of chronic
inflammation or following operative or spontaneous evacuation of pus from the
part. They are either firmly connected with the skin or are detachable from it,
and when laid open disclose a whitish-red, porklike tissue surrounding a
central nucleus of pus, or a fistulous tract leading to the outer surface. They
are caused by the chronic inflammation which follows the bruises received by
cattle in lying down and in rising, or they may be due to falls on uneven, hard
ground.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for hygromata</em>.&mdash;When the swelling first appears cold water
should be applied, followed later by bandaging with cloths wrung out of warm
water. If the swelling is soft, it should be punctured at the lowest point, and
afterwards the cavity should be syringed with Lugol's solution. If the tumor is
hard and nonfluctuating, a mercurial blister may cause absorption and at the
same time prevent further injury to the part by making it more painful, thus
sparing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serous cysts</span>.&mdash;These swellings are another
variety of extravasation cysts, and are caused by such injuries as butting,
running against hard objects, and shipping bruises, which are followed by an
outpouring of blood and lymph into the tissue spaces. These cysts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>develop
rapidly and may reach the size of a man's head or even larger. They are soft,
edematous, and hot at first and contain a serous or blood-tinged fluid. Later,
partially organized clots and shreds of a fibrinous nature and of a gelatinous
consistence are formed within, and the temperature of the swelling is reduced.
They appear on the surface of the body, especially on the belly and flank of
cattle.</p>

<p><em>Treatment of serous cysts</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in opening the cyst at
the most dependent point with a sharp knife. The cavity should be washed out
twice daily with a 5 per cent solution of carbolic acid, and drainage
encouraged by keeping the incision open.</p>

<h5>DERMOID CYSTS.</h5>

<p>These cysts have a wall which is almost an exact duplicate of the structure
of the skin, and frequently contain epidermal structures, such as hair and
teeth, which, in the development of the embryo, have been misplaced. Thus we
may find in an ovary or testicle a dermoid cyst, containing a tooth or a
ball of hair. Dental cysts are included in the class above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dental cysts</span>.&mdash;It happens occasionally that
the teeth of cattle, instead of developing normally within strong supporting
alveolÃ¦, remain inclosed within a cystic membrane, which assumes a tumorlike
character. One tooth may be included alone in the cyst or a number may be
inclosed together. However this may be, the malformation progresses, especially
if confined to the incisor teeth, until the remaining teeth that began to
develop normally are crowded out of position and rendered useless. The tumor
may reach the size of a man's fist. It appears to be fleshy and dents upon
pressure, but it may also appear on closer examination as though it contained
irregular sections of thin bone. The outer surface is always smooth, and no
indication of purulence, softening, or scab formation is ever exhibited. Upon
being laid open with the knife the tumor is seen to be surrounded by a firm,
smooth membrane which limits it completely from the adjoining tissues. It is
filled with material which possesses partly edematous, partly fleshy, and
partly bony properties. It is supposed that this mass is composed of rudiments
of the jawbone or of the alveolar walls which, becoming spongy, lose themselves
in the soft, fleshy mass contained within the capsule of the tumor. It
occasionally happens that the tumor is hollow and that the cavity extends back
into the body of the lower jaw for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>Tumors of this kind, being of congenital origin, are very naturally observed
most frequently in young cattle, but they may continue to expand for a period
of several months after the birth of the calf, even until they become
troublesome and unsightly.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment for dental cysts</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in the complete
extirpation of the cyst and the destruction of the lining pouch by
curetting.</p>

<h5>RETENTION CYSTS.</h5>

<p>Retention cysts arise from the retention of normal secretions, owing to
obstruction of a duct leading from a gland. The mucous cysts found in the
mouth, udder, and vestibule of cows are samples of this form.</p>

<p>MUCOUS CYSTS.&mdash;Saclike dependent tumors, caused by retention of the
secretions from the mucous glands, sometimes develop in the mouth, nose,
pharynx, and vulva of cattle. They are called "mucous cysts." These are of
sizes varying from peas to pigeon eggs, are roundish and translucent, and
surrounded by a delicate, vascular membrane. They contain a siruplike substance
more or less thick and transparent and whitish yellow in color.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in the puncturing of the swelling, if accessible, and the
destruction of the cyst walls by the injection of Lugol's solution.</p>

<h5>PROLIFERATION CYSTS.</h5>

<p>These are found especially in the ovaries of cows, called "cystic ovaries,"
and may produce nymphomania (chronic bulling).</p>

<p>The treatment indicated in this case is the removal of the diseased
ovaries.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_SKIN" id="DISEASES_OF_THE_SKIN"></a>DISEASES OF
THE SKIN.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">M. R. Trumbower, D. V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by John R. Mohler, V. M. D.]</h5>

<h4>GENERAL DISCUSSION.</h4>

<p>The skin consists of two parts&mdash;a superficial layer, the epidermis, or
cuticle, and the deep, or true, skin, the dermis, cutis vera, or corium.</p>

<p>The epidermis, cuticle, or scarf skin, is an epithelial structure, forming a
protective covering to the corium. It varies in thickness, is quite insensible
and nonvascular, and consists of a sheet of cells.</p>

<p>The epidermis is divided into a firm and transparent superficial and a deep,
soft layer. The latter is the rete mucosum, whose cells contain the pigment
which gives color to the skin. The deep surface of the epidermis is accurately
molded on the papillary layer of the true skin, and, when removed by
maceration, presents depressions which correspond to the elevations on the
dermis. From the cuticle tubular prolongations pass into the sebaceous and
sudorific glands; thus the entire surface of the body is inclosed by the
cuticle.</p>

<p>The dermis, or true skin, is vascular and highly sensitive, containing the
tactile ends of the nerves of touch. It is covered by epidermis and attached to
the underlying parts by a layer of areolar tissue, which usually contains fat.
The cutis consists of a fibro-areolar tissue and vessels of supply. It is
divided into two layers, the deep, or true, corium and the upper, or papillary.
The corium consists of strong interlacing fibrous bands, chiefly white; its
meshes are larger and more open toward the attached surface, giving lodgment to
the sweat glands and fat. The papillary, or superficial, layer is formed of a
series of small conical eminences or papillÃ¦, which are highly sensitive, and
consists of a homogenous, transparent tissue. The blood vessels form dense
capillary plexuses in the corium, terminating by loops in the papillÃ¦. The
papillary nerves run in a waving manner, usually terminating in loops.</p>

<p>Hair is an appendage of the skin and forms its external covering. It is a
special modification of epidermis, having the same essential structure, and
consists of a root, shaft, and point. The root has a bulbous extremity, is
lighter and softer than the stem, and is lodged in a recess or hair follicle,
which may either be in the corium or subcutaneous areolÃ¦. The follicle is
dilated at the bottom to correspond <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321"
id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>to the root bulb, and the ducts of one or
more sebaceous glands open into it. At the bottom of each follicle is a
conical, vascular papilla, similar in every respect to those on the surface of
the dermis; this papilla fits into a corresponding depression in the root of
the hair. The shaft consists of a center, or medulla, a surrounding fibrous
portion, and an external coating, or cortex. The medulla consists of cells
containing pigment or fat, is opaque, and deeply colored. All kinds of hair do
not have this medulla. The fibrous portion occupies the bulk of the stem, and
the cortex is merely a single layer of thin, flat, imbricated (shinglelike)
scales.</p>

<p>The sebaceous glands, lodged in the corium, are most abundant in parts
exposed to friction. They generally open into the hair follicles, occasionally
on the surface of the body. Each gland consists of a small duct which
terminates in a lobulated recess. These lobules vary, and are, as is the duct,
lined with epithelium. They are filled with sebaceous matter which, as it is
secreted, is detached into the sacs. They are very plentiful between the claws
of cattle.</p>

<p>The sudorific glands, or sweat glands, are situated in the subcutaneous
areolar tissue, surrounded by a quantity of fat. They are small, round, reddish
bodies, each of which consists of one or more fine tubes coiled into a ball,
the free end of the tube being continued up through the true skin and cuticle,
and opening on the surface. Each sweat gland is supplied with a cluster of
capillary blood vessels which vary in size, being very large when perspiration
is excessive. The contents of the smaller ones are fluid, and of the larger,
semifluid.</p>

<p>The skin may be regarded as an organ supplementary in its action to the
lungs and kidneys, since by its secretion it is capable of removing a
considerable quantity of water from the blood; it also removes small quantities
of carbon dioxid, salts, and in certain instances during suppression of the
renal secretions a small quantity of urea. The skin is also the chief organ for
the regulation of animal heat, by or through conduction, radiation, and
evaporation of water, permitting of loss of heat, while it also, through other
mechanisms, is able to regulate the heat lost. The hair furnishes protection
against extreme and sudden variations of temperature by reason of the fact that
hairs are poor conductors of heat, and inclose between them a still layer of
air, itself a nonconductor. The hairs are also furnished with an apparatus by
which the loss of heat may be regulated; thus, in cold weather, through the
contraction of unstriped muscular fibers of the skin, the hairs become erect
and the external coat becomes thicker. Cold, too, acts as a stimulus to the
growth of hair, and we find, in consequence, a thicker coat in winter than in
summer. The hairs also furnish protection against wet, as they are always more
or less oily from the secretion of sebaceous glands, and thus shed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
water. Through their elasticity they furnish mechanical protection, and through the
thickness of the coat, to a certain degree, resist the attacks of insects.
Finally, the hairs assist the sense of touch.</p>

<p>The sweat glands are constantly discharging a watery secretion in the form
of insensible perspiration, and by their influence act as regulators of the
temperature of the body; hence, in warm weather, the secretion of the skin is
increased, which tends to prevent overheating. Sweating, in addition to
regulating heat, is also an active agent in removing effete material from the
blood; therefore this secretion can not be checked without danger. If the skin
is covered with an impermeable coating of grease or tar, death results from
blood poisoning, owing to the retention of materials destined to be excreted by
the skin.</p>

<p>All secretion poured out by the skin is not only modified by the condition
of the atmosphere but also by the character and quantity of the food, by the
amount of exercise, and especially by the quantity of fluid taken.</p>

<p>The sebaceous secretion is intended to lubricate the skin and hairs. It
consists of soft, fatty material suspended in water, and is characterized by an
odor peculiar to the animal by which it is secreted.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to classify the various diseases of the skin, for in a
work of this kind it would serve only to confuse the reader.</p>

<p>We shall first consider a class of diseases which are of an inflammatory
type; next, those caused by faulty secretion and abnormal growth; then,
diseases of parasitic origin; lastly, local injuries of the skin.</p>

<h4>PRURITIS (ITCHING).</h4>

<p>We shall consider pruritis first as a distinct subject. It is not a disease,
only a sensation, and therefore a symptom. It is one of the symptoms
accompanying the majority of the diseases which we will consider in this
chapter. It is, then, a functional affection produced by slight irritation from
without or by an internal cause acting upon the sensory nerves of the skin.
Nothing characteristic is seen except the secondary lesions, produced
mechanically by scratching or rubbing.</p>

<p>There are various forms of itching, the result of specific skin diseases,
where the pruritis is a secondary symptom. In such cases it should not be
regarded as an independent affection.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Many causes may induce the condition which we recognize here
as pruritis. The most common one is dirt on the skin, resulting from
insufficient care. If the ceiling of the stable is open, so that dust and straw
may fall, the skin is irritated and pruritis results. It also occurs in some
forms of indigestion.</p>

<p>The parts of the body most exposed to this condition are the croup, the
back, the top of the neck, and the root of the tail.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Another cause is found in affections of the liver and of the kidneys, when
an increase of effete material has to be thrown off by the skin. Morbid
materials circulating in the blood may produce a tickling or smarting sensation
of the skin in their passage from the blood to the free surface of the skin.
Certain irritating substances when eaten may be excreted by the skin, and
coming thus in direct contact with the sensory nerves produce itching, or may
go further and cause distinct inflammation of the skin. In another class of
cases the pruritis may be ascribable to an atrophy, contraction, or hardening
of the skin, when the nerves become irritated by the pressure. These conditions
may be so slightly marked in a thick skin like that of the ox that they can not
be recognized. It is frequently noticed that cattle rub themselves as soon as
they pass from the stable into the open air&mdash;changing from a warm to a
cold atmosphere. Again, we may find one that does all its rubbing in the stall.
We may look for lice, but fail to find them. These conditions are generally
attributable to high feeding and to too close confinement. They may be
associated with inflammatory irritation or not; certainly we fail to discover
any morbid changes in the skin. There is to some extent a delightful sensation
produced by rubbing, and it may partly become a habit of pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;We must place our chief reliance upon a change of food,
plenty of exercise, and in most cases the administration of an active
cathartic&mdash;1 to 1&frac12; pounds of Epsom salt, a handful of common salt, a
tablespoonful of ginger or pepper, mixed with 2 quarts of water, all of which
is to be given at one dose. Afterwards half an ounce of hyposulphite of soda
mixed with the feed may be given twice a day for a week. For an external
application, when the skin is abraded or thickened from rubbing, a solution of
borax, 4 ounces to the quart of water, may be used. Carbolic acid, &frac12; ounce to
a quart of water, will give relief in some cases.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE SKIN.</h4>

<h5>ERYTHEMA.</h5>

<p>This is the simplest form of inflammation of the skin. It consists of an
increased redness, which may occur in patches or involve considerable surface.
The red coloration disappears when pressed by the finger, but soon returns
after the pressure is removed. There is seldom much swelling of the affected
part, though often there is a glutinous discharge which dries and mats the
hair or forms a thin scale upon the skin. In simple erythema the epidermis
alone is affected; when it becomes chronic, fissures form and extend into the
corium, or true skin.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Simple erythema, consisting of an inflammatory irritation, is
seen in very young calves, in which the navels leak. The dis<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>charge being urine,
it causes an irritation of the surrounding skin. Chafing, which is another form
of erythema, is occasionally seen on the udders of cows from rubbing by the
legs; chafing between the legs is not uncommon among fat steers. Chronic
erythema is found in the form of chapped teats of cows and chapped lips in
sucking calves. It frequently occurs in cows when they are turned out in winter
directly after milking, and in others from chafing by the sucking calf. Some
cows are peculiarly subject to sore teats. The fissures when neglected in the
early stage of formation become deep, very painful, often bleeding at the
slightest touch, and when milked in that condition cause the animal to become a
kicker. Occasionally the lower portions of the legs become irritated and
chapped when cattle are fed in a muddy or wet yard in winter, or if they are
compelled to wade through water in frosty weather. Another form of erythema
occurs in young cattle highly fed and closely stabled for a long winter. The
erythema appears in patches, and as it is most common near the end of the
winter it is known as the "spring eruption" or "spring itch."</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In ordinary cases of erythema the removal of the cause and
the application of benzoated oxid of zinc ointment, carbolized cosmoline, or
ichthyol ointment applied a few times, will restore the skin to a healthy
condition.</p>

<p>When there are fissures the zinc ointment is the best. If at the teats, a
milk siphon (<a href="#PLATE_XXIV">Pl. XXIV</a>, fig. 4) should be used instead
of milking by hand, and the calf, if one is suckled, should be taken away. The
calf should be fed by hand if its mouth is affected. When the legs are
irritated or chapped, dry stabling for a few days and the application of tar
ointment will soon heal them.</p>

<h5>URTICARIA (NETTLE RASH, OR SURFEIT).</h5>

<p>This is a mild, inflammatory affection of the skin, characterized by sudden
development of patches of various sizes, from that of a nickel to one as large
as the hand. The patches of raised skin are marked by an abrupt border and are
irregular in form. All the swelling may disappear in a few hours, or it may go
away in one place and reappear on another part of the body. It is always
accompanied with a great desire to rub the affected part. In its simplest type,
as just described, it is never followed by any serous exudation or eruptions,
unless the surface of the skin becomes abraded from scratching or rubbing.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Digestive derangements caused by overloading the stomach when
the animal is turned out to graze in the spring, certain feed constituents,
high feeding of fattening stock, functional derangement of the kidneys, spinal
and other nervous affections, are the most common sources of nettle rash.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The disease consists in paralysis of the nerve ends that control the volume
of the capillary vessels in certain areas of skin, thus permitting the vessels to
expand, their contents in part to exude, and thus produce a soft, circumscribed
swelling.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Administer a full dose of Epsom salt. Give soft, easily
digested feed, and wash the affected parts with a solution of bicarbonate of
soda (common baking soda), 8 ounces to the gallon of water twice a day, or
diluted glycerin may be applied to the skin. If it assumes a persistent
tendency, give a tablespoonful of the following powder in the feed three times
a day: Cream of tartar, sulphur, and nitrate of potassium, equal parts by
weight; mix.</p>

<h5>ECZEMA.</h5>

<p>Eczema is a noncontagious inflammation of the skin, characterized by any or
all of the results of inflammation at once or in succession, such as erythema,
vesicles, or pustules, accompanied with more or less infiltration and itching,
terminating in a watery discharge, with the formation of crusts or in scaling
off. The disease may run an acute course and then disappear, or it may become
chronic; therefore two varieties are recognized, vesicular (or pustular) and
chronic eczema.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Eczema is not so common among cattle as in horses and in dogs,
in which it is the most common of all skin diseases. Among cattle it is
occasionally observed under systems of bad hygiene, filthiness, lousiness,
overcrowding, overfeeding, excessively damp or too warm stables. It is found to
develop now and then in cattle that are fed upon sour substances, distillery
swill, house or garden garbage, etc. Localized eczema may be caused by irritant
substances applied to the skin&mdash;turpentine, ammonia, the essential oils,
mustard, Spanish-fly ointment, etc. Occasionally an eruption with vesiculation
of the skin has been induced by the excessive use of mercurial preparations for
the destruction of lice. It is evident that eczema may arise from local
irritation to the skin or from an autointoxication. Cattle fed on the refuse
from potato-starch factories develop a most obstinate and widespread eczema,
beginning on the legs.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;In accordance with the variety of symptoms during the
progress of the disease we may divide it into different stages or periods: (1)
Swelling and increased heat of the skin; the formation of vesicles, which are
circumscribed, rounded elevations of the epidermis, varying in size from a
pinhead to a split pea, containing a clear, watery fluid; (2) exudation of a
watery, glutinous fluid, formation of crusts, and sometimes suppuration, or the
formation of vesicles containing pus (pustules); (3) scaling off
(desquamation), with redness, and thickening of the skin. From the very
beginning of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the disease the animal commences to rub the affected parts; hence
the various stages may not always be easily recognized, as the rubbing produces
more or less abrasion, thus leaving the skin raw&mdash; sometimes bleeding.
Neither do these symptoms always occur in regular succession, for in some cases
the exudation is most prominent, being very profuse, and serve to spread the
disorder over a large surface. In other cases the formation of incrustations,
or rawness of the skin, is the most striking feature. The disease may be
limited to certain small areas, or it may be diffused over the greater part of
the body; the vesicles, or pustules, may be scattered in small clusters, or a
large number run together. The chronic form is really only a prolongation of
the disease, successive crops of pustules appearing on various portions of the
body, frequently invading fresh sections of the skin, while the older surfaces
form scabs, or crusts, upon the raw, indurated skin.</p>

<p>In old, standing cases the skin breaks, forming fissures, especially on
portions of the body that bend&mdash;the neck and limbs. Thus the disease may
be prolonged indefinitely. When eczema reaches its latest period, either acute
or chronic, desquamation of the affected parts is the most prominent feature.
The formation and shedding of these successive crops of scales constitute the
character of the disease frequently denominated psoriasis.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment of eczema is often anything but a pleasant
task. There is no one method of treatment which always proves successful, no
matter how early it is begun or how small an area is involved. We must endeavor
to remove the cause by giving attention to the general health of the animal and
to its environment. Feeding should be moderate in quantity and not too
stimulating in character&mdash;green feed, bran mashes, ground oats, clean hay,
plenty of salt. If the animal has been fed too high, give an active
purgative&mdash;Epsom salt preferred&mdash;once a week, if necessary, and half
an ounce of acetate or nitrate of potassium may be given in the feed twice a
day. If the animal is in poor condition and debilitated, give a tablespoonful
of the following mixture in feed twice a day: Powdered copperas, gentian,
sulphur, and sassafras bark, equal parts by weight. If the animal is lousy, the
parasite must be destroyed before the eczema can be cured. The external
treatment must vary with the character of the lesions; no irritating
application is to be made while the disease is in its acute vesicular, or
pustular, stage, and, in the chronic stage, active stimulants must be used.
Much washing is harmful, yet crusts and scales must be removed in order to
obtain satisfactory results from the external applications. Both objects,
however, can be attained by judiciously combining the curative agents with such
substances as will at the same time cleanse the parts.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the vesicular stage, when the skin is feverish and the epidermis peeling
off, thus exposing the exuding dermis, an application of boric-acid solution, 2
drams of the acid to 8 ounces of water, often relieves the smarting or itching,
and also serves to check the exudation and dry the surface. If this fails to
have the desired effect compound cresol, 1 ounce to 2 quarts of water, should
be used as a wash. Either of these washes may be used several times a day until
incrustation is well established. Then compound cresol, 1 ounce to 2 quarts of
sweet oil, or the benzoated oxid of zinc ointment, giving the affected surfaces
a thorough application once a day, will be efficacious. When the eczema is not
the result of an external irritant, it takes usually from one to two weeks to
heal.</p>

<p>In chronic eczema, when there is a succession of scabs or scales, indolent
sores or fissures, the white precipitate ointment, nitrate of mercury ointment,
or blue ointment, mixed with equal parts of cosmoline or fresh lard, may be
applied every second day, taking care to protect the parts so that the animal
can not lick it off.</p>

<p>The internal administration of arsenic often yields excellent results in
chronic eczema. Dissolve 1 dram of arsenic and 1 dram of carbonate of potassium
in 1 pint of boiling water, and give 1 ounce of this twice a day in water,
after feeding. An alkali internally may be of service. As such, one may give 2
ounces of bicarbonate of soda twice daily. Sublimed sulphur may also be tried
in ounce doses twice daily.</p>

<h5>PUSTULES (IMPETIGO).</h5>

<p>Impetigo is an inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by the
formation of distinct pustules, about the size of a pea or a bean, without
itching. The pustules develop from the papular layer of the skin, and contain a
yellowish-white pus. After reaching maturity they remain stationary for a few
days, then they disappear by absorption and dry up into crusts, which later
drop off, leaving upon the skin a red spot that soon disappears. Occasionally
the crusts remain firmly adherent for a long time, or they may be raised and
loosened by the formation of matter underneath. The dry crusts usually have a
brown or black appearance.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Impetigo affects sucking calves, in which the disease appears
upon the lips, nostrils, and face. It is attributed to some irritant substance
contained in the mother's milk. Impetigo is also witnessed among grazing
animals, regardless of age, and it especially attacks animals with white hair
and skin. The mouth, face, and limbs become covered with pustules, which may
rupture in a few hours, followed by rapid and successive incrustations; the
scabs fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a>
</span>quently coalesce, covering a large surface; pus may form under them,
and thus the whole thickness of the skin become involved in the morbid process.
This form of the disease is attributed to the local irritant properties of such
plants in the pasture as St. John's wort (<em>Hypericum perforatum</em>), smartweed
(<em>Polygonum hydropiper</em>), vetches, honeydew, etc. Buckwheat, at the time the
seeds become ripe, is said to have caused it; also bedding with buckwheat
straw.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Sucking calves should be removed from the mother, and a
purgative given to the latter to divert the poisonous substance secreted with
the milk. When the more formidable disease among grazing cattle appears, the
pasturage should be changed and the affected parts of the animal thoroughly
anointed once a day with sweet oil containing 2 drams of carbolic acid to the
pint. This should be continued until the crusts soften and begin to drop off,
then the parts may be cleansed thoroughly with warm water and soap.
Subsequently the white precipitate ointment or carbolized cosmoline should be
applied daily until the parts are healed.</p>

<h5>PEMPHIGUS (WATER BLISTERS).</h5>

<p>This is an inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by successive
formations of rounded, irregularly shaped water blisters, varying in size from
a pea to a hen's egg.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Obscure.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The formation of a blister is preceded by a congestion or
swelling of the skin. Yellowish-colored water collects beneath the cuticle,
which raises the latter from its bed in the form of a blister. The blisters
appear in a succession of crops; as soon as one crop disappears another forms.
They usually occur in clusters, each one being distinct, or they may coalesce.
Each crop usually runs its course in a week. The disease is attended with
itching or burning sensations which cause the animal to rub, thereby frequently
producing excoriations and formation of crust on the affected region.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Give a tablespoonful of the following-described mixture in
feed twice a day: Saltpeter, cream of tartar, and sulphur, equal parts by
weight. The blisters should be opened as soon as formed, to allow the escape of
the serum, followed by a wash composed of chlorid of zinc, 1 dram to 15 ounces
of water. When there is any formation of crusts, carbolized cosmoline should be
applied.</p>

<h5>FURUNCULUS (BOILS).</h5>

<p>This is an acute affection of the skin, usually involving its whole
thickness, characterized by the formation of one or more abscesses, originating
generally in a sebaceous gland, sweat gland, or hair <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329"
id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>follicle. They usually terminate by absorption,
or by the formation of a central core, which sloughs out, leaving a deep,
round cavity that soon heals.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Impoverished state of blood, the result of kidney diseases or
of local friction or contusions, with the entrance of pus cocci through the
damaged skin or through a hair follicle or a sebaceous gland.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Boils in cattle usually appear singly, not in clusters; they
may attain the size of a hen's egg. The abscess begins as a small round nodule,
painful on pressure, gradually increases in size until death of the central
portion takes place, then the surface of the skin gives way to internal
pressure and the core is released and expelled. Constitutional symptoms are
generally absent, unless the boils occur in considerable numbers, or by their
size involve a great deal of tissue.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Poulticing to ripen the abscess. If this can not be done,
apply camphorated oil two or three times a day until the core is formed. As
soon as the central or most prominent part becomes soft, the abscess should be
opened to release the core. Then use carbolized cosmoline once a day until the
healing is completed. If the animal is in poor condition, give
tonics&mdash;copperas, gentian, ginger, and sulphur, equal parts by weight, 1
tablespoonful twice a day. If the animal manifests a feverish condition of the
system, give half an ounce of saltpeter twice a day, continuing it several days or a
week.</p>

<h4>FAULTY SECRETIONS AND ABNORMAL GROWTHS OF THE SKIN.</h4>

<h5>PITYRIASIS (SEBORRHEA, DANDRUFF, OR SCURF).</h5>

<p>This is a condition characterized by an excessive secretion of sebaceous
matter, forming upon the skin in small crusts or scales.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;It is ascribable to a functional derangement of the sebaceous
glands, usually accompanied with dryness and loss of pliancy of the skin. The
animal is hidebound, as it is commonly termed, thin in flesh, inclined to rub,
and very frequently lousy. The condition is observed most often toward the
spring of the year. Animals that are continually housed, and the skins of which
receive no cleaning, generally present a coat filled with fine scales, composed
of epithelium from the epidermis and dried sebaceous matter. This, however, is
a physiological condition and compatible with perfect health.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Pityriasis may affect the greater portion of the body,
though usually only certain parts are affected&mdash;the ears, neck, rump, etc.
The skin becomes scurfy, the hairy coat filled with branlike gray or whitish
scales.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Nutritious feed, such as oil-cake meal, bran, ground oats,
and clean hay. In the spring the disease generally disappears after the animal
is turned out to pasture. When lice are present they should be destroyed.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
</p>

<h5>ELEPHANTIASIS (SCLERODERMA).</h5>

<p>This condition consists in a chronic thickening of the skin, which may
affect one or more limbs or involve the whole integument. It is characterized
by recurrent attacks of swelling of the skin and subcutaneous areolar tissue.
After each attack the affected parts remain infiltrated to a larger extent than
before, until finally the skin may attain a thickness of an inch, becoming
wrinkled and fissured. In cattle this disease is confined to hot climates. The
predisposing cause is unknown.</p>

<h5>EDEMA (ANASARCA OF THE SKIN).</h5>

<p>This is a dropsical condition of the skin and subcutaneous areolar tissue,
characterized by pitting under pressure, the fingers leaving a dent which
remains a short time.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Edema generally results from a weakened state of the system
arising from previous disease. It may also be dependent upon a functional
derangement of the kidneys, upon weak circulation, or obstruction to the flow
of blood through the lungs. In debilitated animals and in some animals highly
infested with parasites there is swelling of the dewlap or of the fold of the
skin between the jaws.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Painless swelling of a limb, udder, lower surface of
abdomen, or lower jaw becomes apparent. This may increase in dimensions for
several days or may attain its maximum in less than 24 hours. Unless
complicated with some acute disease of a specific character, there is not much,
if any, constitutional disturbance. The deep layer of the skin is infiltrated
with serum, which gives it the characteristic condition of pitting under
pressure.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When the cause can be ascertained and removed we may expect
to see the edema disappear. When no direct specific cause can be discovered and
the animal is debilitated, give general tonic. If, on the contrary, it is in
good flesh, give a purgative, followed by half an ounce of acetate of potassium
twice a day. External applications are useless.</p>

<p>Edema may be distinguished from erysipelas or anthrax by the absence of pain
and fever.</p>

<h5>DERMOID AND SEBACEOUS CYSTS (WENS).</h5>

<p>A dermoid cyst is formed by an involution of the skin with a growth of hair
on the inner wall of the sac. It may become embedded deeply in the subcutaneous
tissues or may just penetrate the thickness of the skin, where it is movable
and painless. They are generally found within the ear or at its base, although
they may form on any part of the body. Usually they have a small opening, from
which a thick, cheesy matter can be squeezed out. The rational treatment is to
dissect them out.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Sebaceous cysts appear not unlike the former. They are formed by a
dilatation of the hair follicle and sebaceous duct within the skin, and contain
a gray or yellowish sebaceous mass. The tumor may attain the size of a cherry
stone or a walnut. Generally they are round, movable, and painless, soft or
doughy in consistency, and covered with skin and hair. They develop slowly. The
best treatment is to dissect out the sac with contents entire.</p>

<h5>VERRUCA (WARTS).</h5>

<p>Cattle are affected with two varieties of warts. One, the verruca vulgaris,
is composed of a cluster of enlarged papillÃ¦, covered with a thickened
epidermis, the number of papillÃ¦ determining the breadth and their length its
height. They are generally circular in figure, slightly roughened on the
surface, and spring from the skin by a broad base. Occasionally large numbers
of very thin, long, pedunculated warts grow from the skin of the ear, lips,
about the eyes, and vulva. Another variety, the verruca acuminata, sometimes
erroneously denominated epithelial cancers, are irregularly shaped elevations,
tufted or club shaped, occasionally existing as thick, short, fleshy
excrescences, giving the growth the appearance of granulation tissue.
Their color is red or purplish, and oftentimes by friction they become raw and
bleeding, emitting then a very offensive odor. They usually grow in clusters
and their development is rapid.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;An abnormal nutrition of the skin, determined by increased
energy of growth operating upon a healthy skin; at other times, upon a weak or
impoverished skin.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When they are small and pedunculated, they may be snipped
off with shears and the stump touched with nitrate of silver. When they are
broad and flattened, they may be dissected out and the wound cauterized if
necessary. If they are large and very vascular, they may be ligated, one by
one, by taking a strong cord and tying it as firmly around the base as
possible. They will then shrivel, die, and drop off. If there is a tendency to
grow again, apply a red-hot iron or nitric acid with a glass rod. Very often
warts quickly disappear if they are kept soft by daily applications of sweet or
olive oil.</p>

<h5>KELIS.</h5>

<p>Kelis is an irregularly shaped flat tumor of the skin, resulting from
hypertrophy&mdash;increased growth of the fibrous tissue of the corium,
producing absorption of the papillary layer.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;It may arise spontaneously or follow a scar after an
injury.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Kelis generally appears below the knee or hock, and may
occur singly or in numbers. There are no constitutional symp<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>toms. Its growth is
very slow and seldom causes any inconvenience. It appears as a flattened,
irregular, or spreading growth within the substance of the skin, is hard to the
touch, and is especially characterized by divergent branches or roots,
resembling the claws of a crab; hence the name. Occasionally some part of it
may soften and result in an abscess. It may grow several inches in length and
encircle the whole limb.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;So long as it causes the animal no inconvenience it is best
not to meddle with it; when it does the animal ought to be fattened for beef,
the meat being perfectly harmless to the consumer.</p>

<h4>PARASITIC DISEASES OF THE SKIN.</h4>

<h5>RINGWORM (TINEA TONSURANS AND TINEA FAVOSA).</h5>

<p>Ringworm is an affection of the skin, caused by a vegetable parasite.</p>

<p>The form known as tinea tonsurans is produced by the presence of a minute or
microscopic fungus&mdash;the <em>Trichophyton tonsurans</em>, which affects the hair and
the epidermic layer of the skin, and is highly contagious, being readily
transmitted from one animal to another. This fungus consists of spores and
filaments. The spores, being the most numerous, are round and seldom vary much
in size. They are very abundant in the hair follicle. The filaments are
articulated, waving, and contain granules. This disease is productive of
changes in the root and shaft of the hair, rendering it brittle and easily
broken off.</p>

<p>This disease becomes manifest by the formation of circular patches on the
skin, which soon becomes denuded of hair. The cuticular layer of the skin in
slightly inflamed, and vesication with exudation occurs, followed by the
formation of scaly, brittle crusts. The patches appear silvery gray when
incrusted, and are mostly confined to the head and neck. It is a common disease
among young cattle in the winter and spring. Very early in the development of
the patches the hairs split, twist, and break off close to the skin. This
disease is attended with more or less itching. It is communicable to man.</p>

<p>Tinea favosa comes from another fungus, the <em>Achorion sch&ouml;nleinii</em>. This
enters the hair follicle and involves the cuticle surrounding it, small crusts
form which increase in diameter and thickness and then become elevated at their
margin, forming a cup-shaped scab, the favus cup, which gives the disease its
distinctive character. The number of these cups varies from a few to many
hundreds. The hairs involved become brittle and broken, fall off with the
crusts, leaving small bald patches. The crusts are of a pale or sulphur-yellow
color at first; as they grow older they turn darker, or to a <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>brown color. This
form of ringworm has a peculiar odor, resembling that of mice or musty straw.
It is occasionally communicated to cattle by man, mice, cats, etc., all being
subject to it.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Remove all crusts by washing with soap and water, then
apply acetic acid, sulphur ointment, tincture of iodin or nitrate of mercury
ointment once a day. Cleanse the stable and whitewash it to destroy the spores
scattered by the crusts.</p>

<h5>OTHER PARASITES AND PARASITIC DISEASES OF THE SKIN.</h5>

<p>For discussion of mange, itch, scab, lousiness, warbles (grub in the skin),
buffalo gnats, hornfly (<em>H&aelig;matobia serrata</em>), ticks, flies, etc., see the
chapter on "The animal parasites of cattle," page 502.</p>

<h4>WOUNDS OF THE SKIN.</h4>

<h5>SNAKE BITES AND VENOMOUS STINGS.</h5>

<p>[See discussion of these subjects in chapter on "Poisons and poisoning."]</p>

<h5>BURNS AND SCALDS.</h5>

<p>This is a rare accident among cattle, yet in cases of fire it may occur. The
application of heat, whether dry or moist, unless sufficient instantly to
destroy the life of a part, is always followed by the development of vesicles
or blisters, which contain a thin, watery fluid. The blisters may be isolated
and not very large, or one blister may cover a very large surface. When the
burn is very severe the skin may be wholly devitalized, or the injury may
extend into the deeper structures of the skin. Then sloughs will
occur, followed by a contraction of the parts in healing; if on a limb, this
may render the animal stiff. When the burn or scald has been a severe one, the
resulting pain is great and the constitutional disturbance very marked.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;For a superficial burn use a mixture of equal parts of
limewater and linseed oil, or common white paint&mdash;white lead ground in
oil&mdash;to exclude the atmosphere and protect the inflamed skin. If it is not
convenient to get anything else, chimney soot, flour, or starch may be spread
on the wound (dry), and covered with cotton batting and light bandage. The
blisters should be opened to let the contained fluid escape, but do not pull
off the thin cuticle which has been raised by the blister. When the burn is
extensive and deep sloughing occurs, the parts should be treated, like other
deep wounds, by poulticing, astringent washes, etc. When the system has
sustained much shock, the animal may require internal stimulants, such as 2
drams of carbonate of ammonia every hour until it rallies. When the pain is
very great, hypodermic injections of 6 grains of morphia may be administered
every six hours.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Frostbite</em> on any portion of the body may be treated as recommended in the
article on diseases of the ears.</p>

<h5>EMPHYSEMA (AIR OR GAS UNDER THE SKIN).</h5>

<p>Emphysema of the skin is not a true disease of the skin, but it is mentioned
as a pathological condition. It is characterized by a distention of the skin
with air or gas contained in the subcutaneous areolar tissue. It may depend
upon a septic condition of the blood, as in anthrax or blackleg, or air may be
forced under the skin about the head, neck, and shoulders, as a result of
rupture of the windpipe. It occurs in the region of the chest and shoulders
from penetrating wounds of the chest and lung, and occasionally follows
puncture of the rumen when the escaping gas is retained under the skin.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>&mdash;The skin is enormously distended over a greater or less
portion of the body; thus any region of the body may lose its natural contour
and appear like a monstrosity. There is a peculiar crackling beneath the skin
when the hand is passed over it, and on tapping it with the fingers a resonant,
drumlike sound is elicited.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Puncture the distended skin with a clean, broad-bladed
knife and press the air out. Further treatment must be directed with a view to
the removal of the cause.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_FOOT" id="DISEASES_OF_THE_FOOT"></a>DISEASES OF
THE FOOT.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">M. R. Trumbower, D. V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]</h5>

<h4>LAMINITIS (FOUNDER).</h4>

<p>Laminitis denotes an active inflammation of the sensitive structures within
the wall of the hoof, which in severe cases may result in suppuration and the
loss of one or more claws. Owing to the simplicity of the structure of the foot
of an ox compared with that of the horse, this disease is rarely seen in an
acute form, but a mild form, commonly called "foot soreness," is not of
infrequent occurrence.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Laminitis in cattle may be caused by overfeeding, overheating,
continued standing without exercise on a stone or cement floor without
sufficient bedding, or by driving long distances over rough or stony soil.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;An unwillingness to maintain the standing position; the
animal persists in lying down. The feet will be found unnaturally hot, and
frequently some swelling may be noticed above the hoof. Pressure upon the hoof
with blacksmith's hoof pincers causes pain and flinching. The general body
temperature is increased and the breathing accelerated. Ordinarily the animal
eats and drinks as usual. When it is made to move excessive tenderness of the
feet becomes manifest, as is shown by reluctance to walk and by the very short,
hesitating step. Founder affects the hind as well as the fore feet, although
the front feet are more often exposed.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Cold packs to the feet, or if the animal can be made to
stand in a stream of water, having a soft bottom, the inflammation is often
relieved without the necessity of any additional treatment. It may be well,
however, to give a full dose of Epsom salt, 1 to 1&frac12; pounds, followed by
half-ounce doses of saltpeter two or three times a day.</p>

<h4>SORENESS (FOOT SORENESS).</h4>

<p>Cattle that have been stabled or pastured on soft ground and are driven over
stony roads soon wear down the soles of their feet and become lame from foot
soreness. Draft oxen, for this reason, require to be shod. When the soreness is
excessive it may develop into an active inflammation of all the sensitive
structures of the foot&mdash;laminitis, or into a local bruise commonly called
a "corn."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Rest, poulticing the feet with moistened clay, followed by
astringent washes&mdash;strong white-oak bark or alum water.</p>

<p>If the pain and heat last several days, it is probable that pus has formed
beneath the wall of the hoof. In this case it is necessary to cut through the
wall, usually at the most prominent part of the sole, to allow the accumulation
to drain out. The animal should then stand for several hours daily in a tub
containing a 3 per cent solution of some good milky coal-tar disinfectant. When
not in the disinfecting solution the foot should be dressed with pine tar and
cotton and bandaged with bagging.</p>

<h4>LOSS OF HOOF.</h4>

<p>Cattle sometimes become fastened between planks or otherwise and pull off
the wall of one or both claws in the effort to extricate themselves. The claws
of one or more feet may be shed as the result of acute laminitis.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Wash the bleeding surface with an antiseptic and then with
an astringent, such as a weak solution of alum, then apply a thick coating of
pine tar; cover this with a layer of oakum or absorbent cotton; apply another
coat of tar over this, and then bandage closely and firmly. This may remain
without disturbance until the new growing wall becomes sufficiently strong to
sustain the pressure and weight of the animal. If, however, at any time oozing
or bad smell indicates that pus is forming under this dressing, the bandage
should be removed and the suppurating surface freshly cleaned and dressed. This
may have to be repeated every few days and should be continued so long as there
is any pus formation. If the loss of hoof is owing to suppurative laminitis,
the parts denuded of the horny covering must be thoroughly cleansed and
disinfected with carbolic acid, lysol, or other antiseptic. Then apply a
moderately thick layer of absorbent cotton and over this apply the tar and
bandage. After this the antiseptic solution may be poured in daily at the top
of the dressing. It will thus soak in and saturate the dressing and inflamed
tissue. It may become necessary to remove all the dressing at daily or longer
intervals to give the parts a fresh cleaning, and then to reapply it.</p>

<h4>FOUL IN FOOT (FOOT ROT).</h4>

<p>A variety of causes may produce inflammation of the foot between the claws
or toes. It may be on account of overgrowth of the claws and inward pressure,
as in ingrowing nail of man, or it may be caused by the irritation of stable
filth by impaction and hardening of soil between the claws, or by other foreign
substances becoming wedged in, causing inflammation and softening or ulceration
of the skin in the interdigital space. Under some conditions several cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>in
the same herd become affected, which has led some to think that the disease may
be contagious. Occurrences have been reported in which foot rot of cattle has
appeared within a short time among a large proportion of the cattle in a
farming district. This disease is most frequently seen in the hind feet, though
all four feet may become affected.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The animal is observed to limp. On examination of the foot
we discover heat and swelling above the hoof and of the soft parts between the
claws which frequently spreads the claws apart to a considerable extent, or the
inflammation may have advanced to softening and sloughing of the interdigital
membrane. If the disease is neglected at this stage, deep abscesses may form
and the pus burrow under the horny wall, or the joint within the hoof may
become inflamed and the articular attachments destroyed, in which case the
treatment will be difficult and recovery will be very tedious.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In the earlier stages of the disease, before pus burrows
beneath the horn, a thorough cleansing and an application of a carbolic-acid
solution&mdash;1 ounce to a pint of water&mdash;clean stabling, and laxative
food will usually remedy the evil. Compound solution of cresol is an excellent
remedy at this stage. It should be applied, in its pure or undiluted state, to
the suppurating and putrefying tissue between the claws. It is best applied by
means of a cotton swab on a thin stick. Care must be taken to keep it from
contact with the skin about the coronary band or heels. If deep sloughing has
taken place the carbolic solution should be used, and a wad of oakum or cotton
smeared with pine tar should be secured firmly in the cleft. This can be done
by taking a strip of strong cloth, 2 inches wide, passing the middle between
the claws, then tying the ends after winding them in opposite directions above
the hoof. Sometimes warm poulticing with flaxseed meal or bran is necessary to
relieve excessive fever and pain. If the pus burrows under the horn, its
channel must be followed by paring away the horn until the bottom is reached.
The aftertreatment is the same as that already recommended. If the joint
becomes diseased an amputation of that toe is the quickest and surest method to
relieve the suffering of the animal, and offers the best chance for an early
recovery.</p>

<h4>ULCERATION OF THE HEEL.</h4>

<p>Occasionally we find ulcers at the junction of the hair with the hoof at the
heel, which present an elevated, raw, or ragged surface, and cause considerable
lameness. This is generally caused by a bruise of the fibrous cushion of the
back part of the foot. Subsequent sloughing or necrosis may occur, or pus may
form deep within the wall and gain an exit at the margin of the heel.
Sometimes, from no visible cause, large pieces of skin slough from the heel and
pastern. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
This condition is caused by an infection with certain microorganisms (streptococci,
necrosis bacilli) and may be contagious.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If there is a deep opening, inject carbolic solution once a
day until it closes. If the ulcer is only superficial, wash with carbolic
solution and apply a mixture of equal parts of blue vitriol and alum in dry
powder.</p>

<h4>FISSURE OF THE WALL (SPLIT HOOF).</h4>

<p>This is rarely seen among cattle. It may occur in weak walls, in heavily
bodied cattle, caused by stepping on an uneven surface, especially when the
point of the toe is grown out long. One may find the point of the toe broken
and the wall split almost up to the hair.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The divided sections may be brought into approximation and
held in place by drilling a small hole from one side into and through the
other, commencing half an inch back of the fissure on each side; then drive a
light horseshoe nail through the hole and clinch it. Pare the injured claw as
short as it will bear.</p>

<h4>INTERDIGITAL FIBROMA.</h4>

<p>Hard, nodular, fibrous tumors sometimes grow in the cleft of the foot, and
cause inconvenience, lameness, absorption, or ulceration of the contiguous
parts.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;They should be dissected out and the wound dressed with
carbolic-acid lotion and pine tar once a day until healing is completed.</p>

<h4>DEFORMITIES.</h4>

<p>Deformities in the feet of cattle usually consist in overgrowth of horn,
generally from want of wear in animals which are stabled. The hoof may turn
inward, outward, or upward, and may give rise to lameness, inability to walk,
foul foot, etc. Bulls which are continually stabled and dairy cows very
frequently have misshapen feet from want of an occasional trimming, and this
deformity may eventually lead to permanent injury.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Cut the superabundant growth of horn down with saw, knife,
or rasp, until the foot assumes its natural form.</p>

<h4>PRICKS AND WOUNDS.</h4>

<p>If an animal suffers with a penetrating wound from prick of fork or nail,
the orifice of the wound should be enlarged to permit a free discharge of pus;
then the foot should be soaked in a cresol compound solution (3 per cent) in a
tub, or a flaxseed poultice applied, changing it three times a day until the
fever has abated. The foot should be kept bandaged and dressed with pine
tar and oakum; the animal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">
[Pg 339]</a></span> must also be kept on a clean floor until the wound is
closed and all or nearly all lameness has disappeared.</p>

<p>If an animal is cut in the foot with barbed wire, piece of glass, or any
other substance, the wound, after proper cleansing, should be dressed with
carbolic-acid solution, 1 ounce of the acid to 20 of water. If any uneven edges
of horn, skin, or lacerated flesh project, trim them off, and in all cases when
it can be done a tarred bandage should be applied. This will serve to sustain
the cut surfaces in their place, exclude dirt, and protect against flies,
maggots, etc.</p>

<p>When the wound has extended into a joint, surgical treatment, which will
require the services of an educated veterinarian, may be necessary.</p>

<p>Occasionally an animal gets caught by the foot in a crevice and sustains
severe bruising, wrenching, or fracture of some part of the foot. In such cases
cold-water packs to the injured member are of service until the fever and
swelling disappear. Afterwards the animal should rest until the usefulness of
the foot is restored. Sometimes such an accident, causing fracture, renders
necessary plaster bandages or amputation.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_EYE_AND_ITS_APPENDAGES"
id="DISEASES_OF_THE_EYE_AND_ITS_APPENDAGES"></a>DISEASES OF THE EYE AND ITS
APPENDAGES.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">M. R. Trumbower, D. V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]</h5>

<h4>DESCRIPTION.</h4>

<p>For the sake of gaining a clear comprehension of the diseases of the eye it
becomes necessary to review the anatomy of this important organ. The essential
organ of vision, or globe of the eye, will be first described, then its
receptacle or orbital cavity, the muscles that move it, the protective
membranes, or eyelids, the membrana nictitans, or accessory eyelids, and,
lastly, the lacrimal apparatus.</p>

<p>The globe or ball of the eye is almost spherical in form. On closer
inspection, however, it appears to be made up of two combined portions from
spheres of different sizes. The posterior portion, forming about five-sixths of
the ball, is a sphere of comparatively large size with a small segment cut off
it in front, and at this point there is applied to it the anterior portion,
which, being a segment of a smaller sphere, projects at the front of the ball
with a greater convexity than the posterior portion.</p>

<p>The eyeball consists of concentrically arranged coats and of refracting
media inclosed in them. The coats are three in number, namely, (1) an external
protective tunic made up of the sclerotic and cornea; (2) a middle vascular and
pigmentary tunic, the choroid; (3) an internal nervous layer, the retina. The
sclerotic is the white, opaque part of the outer tunic, of which it forms about
the posterior five-sixths, being coextensive with the larger sphere already
mentioned. The cornea forms the remaining one-sixth of the outer tunic, being
coextensive with the segment of the smaller sphere. It is distinguished from
the sclerotic by being colorless and transparent. The choroid coat will be
recognized as the black layer lying subjacent to the sclerotic. It does not
line the cornea, but terminates behind the line of junction of that coat with
the sclerotic by a thickened edge&mdash;the ciliary processes. At the line of
junction of the sclerotic and cornea the iris passes across the interior of the
eye. This (which may be viewed as a dependency of the choroid) is a muscular
curtain perforated by an aperture termed the pupil. The retina will be
recognized as a delicate, glassy layer, lining the greater part of the
choroid.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The refracting media of the eye are three in number, namely (1) the aqueous
humor, a watery fluid inclosed in a chamber behind the cornea; (2) the
crystalline lens and its capsule, a transparent, soft solid of a biconvex form,
and placed behind the iris; (3) the vitreous humor, a transparent material with
a consistence like thin jelly, and occupying as much of the interior of the eye
as is subjacent to the choroid.</p>

<p>The sclerotic is a strong, opaque, fibrous membrane, which, in a great
measure, maintains the form of the eyeball and protects the more delicate
structures within it. Its interior portion, which is covered by the ocular
conjunctiva, is commonly known as the "white of the eye." In form it is
bell-shaped, and the optic nerve pierces it behind like a handle, the
perforation being a little to its inner side. In front, the rim of the bell
becomes continuous with the cornea. The outer surface of the membrane receives
the insertion of the muscles of the eyeball. The coat is thickest over the
posterior part of the eyeball, and is thinnest a little behind its junction
with the cornea.</p>

<p>The cornea is the anterior transparent portion of the outer coat of the
eyeball. It may be viewed as a part of the sclerotic specially modified to
permit the passage of light into the interior of the eye. Its outline is
elliptical, nearly circular, and its greatest diameter is transverse. At its
periphery it joins the sclerotic by continuity of tissue, and as the edge of
the cornea is slightly beveled and has the fibrous sclerotic carried for a
little distance forward on its outward surface, the cornea is generally said to
be fitted into the sclerotic like a watch glass into its rim. The venous canal
of Schlemm runs circularly around the eyeball at the line of junction of the
sclerotic and cornea. The anterior surface of the cornea is exquisitely smooth,
and is kept moist by the lacrimal secretions. Its posterior surface forms the
anterior boundary of the chamber in which the aqueous humor is contained. The
cornea is of uniform thickness and is of a dense, almost horny, consistence.
Save a few capillary loops of blood vessels at its margin the cornea is without
vessels. Its structure is comprised of five distinct layers.</p>

<p>The aqueous humor occupies a chamber which is bounded in front by the
posterior surface of the cornea and behind by the capsule and
suspensory ligament of the lens and by the ends of the ciliary processes. It is
across this chamber that the iris extends. The aqueous humor is composed of
water, with a small proportion of common salt in solution.</p>

<p>The iris is a muscular, pigmented curtain extending across the interior of
the eye and having about its center an aperture termed the pupil. By variations
in the size of this aperture the amount of light transmitted to the retina is
regulated. It varies somewhat in color, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342"
id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>but is most frequently of a yellowish-brown tint.
Its anterior face is bathed by the aqueous humor. The greater part of the
posterior surface is in contact with the capsule of the lens and glides on it
during the movements of the curtain. The circumferential border is attached
within the junction of the sclerotic cornea. The inner border circumscribes
the pupil, which varies in outline according to its size. When much contracted
the pupil is a very elongated ellipse, the long axis of which is in the line
joining the nasal and temporal angles of the eyelids. It contains muscular
tissue, which, by contracting or relaxing, lessens or dilates the pupillary
opening.</p>

<p>The choroid coat is a bell-shaped, dark membrane which lines the sclerotic.
Its outer surface has a shaggy appearance, caused by the tunica fusca, which
unites the two coats. Between the two the ciliary vessels and nerves pass
forward. Behind it is pierced by the optic nerve; in front it is continued as
the ciliary processes, which form, as it were, the rim of the bell. The ciliary
processes form a fringe around the slightly inverted rim of the choroid.</p>

<p>The retina is the most delicate of the coats of the eyeball. It is formed by
the expansion of the optic nerve on the inner surface of the choroid, and, like
that coat, it is bell-shaped. Its inner surface is molded on the vitreous
humor. The nervous structures of the retina terminate at a wavy line, the ora
serrata, behind the ciliary processes. Ten distinct layers are described as
composing the thickness of the retina.</p>

<p>The lens is situated behind the pupil and is contained within a capsule of
its own.</p>

<p>The capsule is a close-fitting, firm, transparent membrane. The anterior
surface forms the posterior boundary of the cavity containing the aqueous
humor, and the iris in its movement glides on it. The posterior surface is in
contact with the vitreous humor.</p>

<p>The vitreous humor occupies four-fifths of the interior of the eyeball. It
is globular in form, with a depression in front for the lodgment of the lens.
It is colorless, transparent, and of a consistency like thin jelly. It is
enveloped by a delicate capsule&mdash;the hyaloid membrane&mdash;which is
connected in front with the suspensory ligament of the lens, and ends by
joining the capsule behind the lens.</p>

<p>The orbital cavity, at the side of the head, is circumscribed by a bony
margin; posteriorly, however, there are no bony walls, and the cavity is often
confounded with the depression above and behind the orbit&mdash;the temporal
fossa. A fibrous membrane completes this cavity and keeps it
distinct from the temporal fossa. This membrane&mdash;the ocular sheath or
periorbita&mdash;is attached posteriorly around the opening in the back part of
the orbital cavity (the orbital hiatus) and anteriorly to its inner face; then
it becomes prolonged beyond the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343"
id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> margin to form the fibrous membrane of the
eyelids. When complete the orbital cavity has the form of a regular hollow
cone, open at its base and closed at the apex. The opening of this cone is
directed forward, downward, and outward. Independently of the globe of the eye,
this cavity lodges the muscles that move it, the membrana nictitans, and the
lacrimal gland.</p>

<p>The muscles of the eye are seven in number&mdash;one retractor, four
straight, and two oblique. The retractor oculi envelops the optic nerve between
the brain and the ball of the eye and becomes attached upon the external face
of the sclerotic tunic. When this muscle contracts, it draws the globe back
into the orbit, away from the light. The superior, inferior, external, and
internal recti or straight muscles are attached to the back part of the orbital
sheath and spread forward in four bundles over the globe of the eye, where they
are inserted by a fibrous expansion into the sclerotic at the margin of the
cornea. When they act singly, they turn the globe either upward, downward,
inward, or outward. The great oblique, by its action, pivots the eye inward and
upward in the orbit. The small oblique turns the eye outward and downward.</p>

<p>The eyelids are two movable curtains, superior and inferior, which cover and
protect the eye in front. They are attached to the circumference of the orbit
and have a convex external face formed by the skin and a concave internal face
molded on the anterior surface of the eye and are lined by the conjunctiva,
which is reflected above and below on the eyeball. The border of each lid is
slightly beveled on the inner side and shows the openings of the Meibomian
glands. These glands secrete an unctuous fluid, which is thrown out on the
border of the lids, the function of which is to facilitate their movements and
enable them to retain the tears in the ocular cavity. The eyelid is composed of
a fibrous inner membrane ending in a stiff arch near the border, a muscle to
close the lid, another to open it, the skin externally, and the conjunctival
mucous membrane internally. The border of each lid is covered and protected by
long hairs to prevent floating particles of matter in the atmosphere from
gaining entrance to the eye.</p>

<p>The membrana nictitans, which is also named the third eyelid, winking
eyelid, haw, etc., is placed at the inner angle of the eye, whence it extends
over the eyeball to relieve it from foreign bodies which may fall upon it. It
has for its framework a fibro-cartilage, irregular in shape, thick, nearly
prismatic at its base, and thin anteriorly where it is covered by the
conjunctiva; behind, it is loosely attached to a fatty cushion.</p>

<p>The lacrimal gland is situated between the orbital process and the upper
part of the eyeball. It secretes the tears destined to lubricate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a>
</span> the anterior surface of the eye. This fluid escapes upon the
organ at the outer angle of the lids and is carried between them and
the eyeball toward the inner angle.</p>

<p>The caruncula lacrimalis is a small round body, frequently entirely or
partially black, situated in the inner angle of the eye, and is designed to
direct the tears toward the puncta lacrimalia.</p>

<p>The puncta lacrimalia are two little openings, situated one in each eyelid,
a short distance from the inner corner, which admit the tears into the lacrimal
ducts leading to the lacrimal canal, whence they are emptied into the nasal
passages.</p>

<h4>CONJUNCTIVITIS (SIMPLE OPHTHALMIA).</h4>

<p>This is an inflammation of the conjunctival mucous membrane of the eyeball
and lids; in severe cases the deeper coats of the eye are involved, seriously
complicating the attack.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;It may result from a bruise of the eyelid; from the
introduction of foreign matters into the eye, as chaff, hayseed, dust, gnats,
etc.; from exposure to cold; poisonous or irritating vapors arising from
filthiness of stable. Dust, cinders, or sand blown into the eyes during
transportation frequently cause conjunctivitis.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;A profuse flow of tears, closure of the eyelids from
intolerance of light, retraction of the eyeball and corresponding protrusion of
the haw, disinclination to move, diminution of milk secretion, etc. On parting
the lids the lining membrane is found injected with an excess of blood, giving
it a red and swollen appearance; the sclerotic, or white of the eye, is
bloodshot and the cornea may be cloudy. If the disease advances, keratitis
results, with its train of unfavorable symptoms.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Careful examination should be made to discover particles of
chaff, etc., which may have lodged in the eye, and upon the discovery of such a
cause prompt removal is indicated. This may be accomplished by flushing the eye
with warm water by means of a syringe, or, if the foreign substance is adherent
to the eyeball or lid, it may be scooped out with the handle of a teaspoon or
some other blunt instrument. To relieve the congestion and local irritation, a
wash composed of boracic acid in freshly boiled water, 20 grains to the ounce,
or acetate of zinc, 5 grains to the ounce of pure soft water, may be used, to
which may be added 20 drops of laudanum. A few drops of this should be placed
in the eye with a camel's-hair pencil or soft feather three or four times
daily. The animal should be placed in a cool, darkened stable; then a cloth
folded into several thicknesses should be fastened to the horns in such manner
as to reach below the eyes. This should be kept wet with cold water during the
day and removed at night. If there is much fever and <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>constitutional disturbance,
it becomes advisable to administer 1 pound of Epsom salt dissolved in 1
quart of water.</p>

<h4>INFECTIOUS CATARRHAL CONJUNCTIVITIS (SPECIFIC OPHTHALMIA).</h4>

<p>This generally appears in an enzootic or epizootic form and affects a
considerable number in the herd. It is distinctly a contagious disease and may
be brought into a previously healthy herd by one infected animal. It may
continue in a herd for a season or for several years, affecting all newly
purchased animals. It is seldom seen in the winter months. It affects old and
young animals alike.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;This form of catarrh conjunctivitis is characterized chiefly
by a mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, an intense degree of inflammation of
the mucous membrane, accompanied with swelling of the eyelids and an early
opacity of the cornea. The flow of tears is mixed with pus, sometimes streaked
with blood, and the skin of the face is kept moist and soiled. The eyes are
kept continually closed. The implication of the cornea in the disease
frequently blinds the animal for a time, and occasionally suppurative
keratitis, ulcers of the cornea, or staphyloma supervene. The attack is marked
from the onset by fever, partial loss of appetite, partial loss of milk,
suspended rumination, and separation from the herd.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The animal should be housed in a cool, dark stable,
supplied with plenty of fresh water to drink and soft, succulent feed.
Administer 1 pound of Epsom salt&mdash;if a very large animal, use 1&frac12;
pounds&mdash;dissolved in 2 or 3 pints of water. For an eyewash, take boracic
acid, 1 dram, and pour 4 ounces of boiling water over it. Use this as often as
is convenient, applying it directly to the eye. In the majority of cases
improvement becomes manifest in a few days, and the eye becomes clear and free
from inflammation in 10 days or 2 weeks. Where the disease develops ulceration
of the cornea, or well-marked, deep-seated keratitis, the treatment recommended
for those conditions should be adopted.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Whenever this affection appears in a herd all the
unaffected animals should be moved to fields which possess a different
character of soil and feed. The water should also be changed, especially if
they have been obtaining it from a stagnant pond.</p>

<h4>KERATITIS (CORNEITIS).</h4>

<p>This is an inflammation of the cornea proper, although the sclerotic at the
corneal border becomes involved to some extent. It may be divided into
diffuse and suppurative.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;The cornea constitutes the most prominent portion of the
eyeball, hence it is subject to a variety of injuries&mdash;scratches, pricks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
contusions, lacerations, etc. Inflammation of the cornea may also be due to the
extension of catarrhal conjunctivitis or intraocular disease, and it may
occasionally occur without any perceptible cause.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Diffuse keratitis is characterized by an exudation into and
an opacity of the cornea. The swelling of the anterior part of the eyeball may
be of an irregular form, in points resembling small bladders, or it may
commence at the periphery of the cornea by an abrupt thickening, which
gradually diminishes as it approaches the center. If the whole cornea is
affected, it has a uniform gray or grayish-white appearance. The flow of tears
is not so marked as in conjunctivitis, nor is the suffering so acute, though
both conditions often exist together. Both eyes usually become affected, unless
it is caused by an external injury.</p>

<p>In favorable cases the exudate within the cornea begins to disappear within
a week or 10 days, the eye becomes clearer and regains its transparency, until
it eventually is fully restored. In unfavorable cases blood vessels form and
are seen to traverse the affected part from periphery to center, vision becomes
entirely lost, and permanent opacity (albugo or leucoma) remains. When it
arises from constitutional causes recurrence is frequent, leaving the corneal
membrane more cloudy after each attack, until the sight is permanently lost.</p>

<p>Suppurative keratitis may be a sequel of diffuse keratitis; more commonly,
however, it abruptly becomes manifest by a raised swelling on or near the
center of the cornea that very soon assumes a yellow, turbid color, while the
periphery of the swelling fades into an opaque ring. Suppurative keratitis is
seldom noticed for the first day or two&mdash;not until distinct pus formation
has occurred. When it is the result of diffuse keratitis, ulceration and the
escape of the contained pus is inevitable; otherwise the pus may be absorbed.
When the deeper membranes covering the anterior chamber of the eye become
involved, the contents of this chamber may be evacuated and the sight
permanently lost.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Place the animal in a darkened stable, give green or sloppy
feed, and administer 4 ounces of Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda) dissolved in
a quart of water once a day. If the animal is debilitated a tablespoonful of
tonic powder should be mixed with the feed three times a day. This may be
composed of equal parts by weight of powdered copperas (sulphate of iron),
gentian, and ginger. As an application for the eye, nitrate of silver, 3 grains
to the ounce of soft water, with the addition of 1 grain sulphate of morphia,
may be used several times a day. If ulceration occurs, it is well to dust
powdered calomel into the eye twice daily, or apply to the eyelids a salve of
yellow oxid of mercury, 5 per cent in lanolin. Some of this may go on to the
cornea and beneath the lids. Apply twice daily. (See "Ulcers of the
cornea.")</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
</p>

<p>To remove opacity, after the inflammation has subsided, apply a few drops of
the following solution twice a day: Iodid of potassium, 15 grains; tincture
sanguinaria, 20 drops; distilled water, 2 ounces; mix.</p>

<p>Sometimes keratitis exists in a herd as a transmissible disease, spreading
like infectious conjunctivitis. Calomel, applied to the eye, is especially
useful in such cases.</p>

<h4>ULCERS OF THE CORNEA.</h4>

<p>An ulcer comes from erosion or is the consequence of the bursting of a small
abscess, which may have formed beneath the delicate layer of the conjunctiva,
continued over the cornea; or, in the very substance of the cornea itself,
after violent keratitis, or catarrhal conjunctivitis. At other times it is
produced by bruises, scratches, or other direct injury of the cornea.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The ulcer is generally at first of a pale gray color, with
its edges high and irregular, discharges instead of pus an acrid, watery
substance, and has a tendency to spread widely and deeply. If it spreads
superficially upon the cornea, the transparency of this membrane is lost; if it
proceeds deeply and penetrates the anterior chamber of the aqueous humor, this
fluid escapes, the iris may prolapse, and the lens and the vitreous humor
become expelled, thus producing destruction of the whole organ.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;It is of the greatest importance, as soon as an ulcer
appears upon the cornea, to prevent its growing larger. The corroding process
must be converted into a healthy one. For this purpose nothing is more reliable
than the use of solid nitrate of silver. A stick of this medicine should be
scraped to a point; the animal's head should be firmly secured; an assistant
should part the lids; if necessary, the haw must be secured within the corner
of the eye and then all parts of the ulcer should be lightly touched with the
silver. After waiting a few minutes the eye should be thoroughly washed out
with a very weak solution of common salt. This operation generally has to be
repeated at the end of three or four days. If healthy action succeeds, the
ulcer assumes a delicate fleshy tint, and the former redness around the ulcer
disappears in proportion as the ulcer heals.</p>

<p>In superficial abrasions of the cornea, where there is no distinct
excavation, this caustic treatment is not needed. The eye should be bathed
several times a day with sulphate of zinc, 30 grains to half a pint of soft
water, and protected against exposure to cold air and sunlight. Excessive
ulceration sometimes assumes the form of fungous excrescence upon the cornea,
appearing to derive its nourishment from loops of blood vessels of the
conjunctiva. Under these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">
[Pg 348]</a></span>circumstances the fungoid mass must be cut away and
the wound cauterized with the nitrate of silver, or else the eye will soon be
destroyed. When ulcers of the cornea appear indolent, with a tendency to
slough, in addition to the treatment already prescribed, tonic powders of
copperas, gentian, and ginger, equal parts by weight, should be given twice a
day, mixed with the feed; dose, one tablespoonful.</p>

<h4>STAPHYLOMA.</h4>

<p>This is a disease of the eyeball, in which the cornea loses its
transparency, rises above the level of the eye, and even projects beyond the
eyelids in the form of an elongated, whitish, or pearl-colored tumor, which is
sometimes smooth, at other times uneven.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Inflammation is the only known cause, although it may not
occur immediately; it frequently follows catarrhal conjunctivitis and keratitis
as a sequela.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In a few cases restoration of sight may be effected by
puncturing the projecting tumor and treating it afterwards with nitrate of
silver in the same manner as prescribed for ulceration of the cornea. In some
cases spontaneous rupture has occurred, and healing without any treatment at
all.</p>

<h4>CATARACT.</h4>

<p>In cataract the crystalline lens becomes opaque and loses its transparency,
the power of refraction is lost&mdash;the animal can not see.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Cataract generally arises from a diminution (atrophy) or other
change in the nutrition of the lens; it may occur as a result of inflammation
of the deep structures of the eye. Cataract may be simple, or complicated with
amaurosis, adhesions, etc.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;It is known by the whiteness or loss of transparency of the
lens, although the pupil dilates and contracts. Sight may be totally lost;
however, evidence is usually manifested that the animal distinguishes light
when brought out of a darkened stable. For the most part the formation of
cataract takes place slowly, the cases in which it originates very quickly
being but few.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;There is only one method for the treatment of
cataract&mdash;a surgical operation for the removal of the lens; but this is
not advisable, for the sight can not be perfectly restored, and objects would
be seen imperfectly without the aid of glasses.</p>

<h4>AMAUROSIS.</h4>

<p>This is a paralysis of the nerve of sight or the expansion of the retina.</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;This is the result of concussion from a blow upon the
forehead, fracture of bone over the eye (causing downward pressure),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
rheumatic inflammation of the optic nerve, or from extension of deep inflammation
of the eye involving the retina. It sometimes occurs as the result of excessive loss
of blood or of great debility.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;In this disease observation is seldom made until the animal
in its gait and by its action indicates blindness. Generally both eyes are
affected. The eyeball remains clear, and the pupil is permanently dilated. No
response to light is manifested.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If caused by debility, loss of blood, or associated with
rheumatism, general blood tonics may be given in the feed, namely, powdered
sulphate of iron, 1 dram; gentian, 2 drams; nux vomica, one-half dram; to be
given twice a day. In cases of rheumatism, one-half ounce of saltpeter may be
added.</p>

<h4>FILARIA OCULI (WORM IN THE EYE).</h4>

<p><em>Filaria oculi</em> (provisionally taken as the larva of <em>F. cervina</em>) is a small
white worm, found swimming in the aqueous fluid in the anterior chamber. It may
be apparently harmless for a long time, but will eventually induce keratitis
with inflammatory exudations.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The cornea may be punctured at its upper and outer margin,
and the worm squeezed out with the aqueous humor. The latter will be formed
again. This operation results disastrously unless the greatest care and skill
are employed.</p>

<h4>CORNEAL DERMATOMA (HAIRY TUMOR ON THE EYEBALL).</h4>

<p>In a few instances this has been seen as a congenital growth. The tumor
arises from the cornea or the sclerotic, covered by its respective membrane,
with a growth of hair upon its surface. These tumors may be quite prominent or
flattened, and are dark in color; the hair may protrude between the eyelids,
giving the animal the appearance of having a double eyelid.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A surgical operation becomes necessary for their
removal&mdash; one requiring a skilled operator.</p>

<h4>STRABISMUS (SQUINTING).</h4>

<p>This is a very rare affection among cattle. Strabismus may be either single
or double&mdash;affecting one eye or both. It is caused by a paralysis, or a
weakening of one of the straight muscles of the eyeball. Generally it is a
congenital defect, and the squinting is toward the nose&mdash;strabismus
convergens. It is best not to attempt to remedy the defect, as the risk in an
operation is greater than the chances of success warrant.</p>

<h4>PTERYGIUM.</h4>

<p>This term is applied to a flesh-colored membrane, triangular in form, which
most frequently grows from the inner angle of the eye <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>and extends over the
cornea, thus interfering with vision. It may grow from the outer angle, or even
from either the superior or inferior hemisphere of the eyeball. The figure is
invariably that of a triangle, with its base on the white of the eye and its
apex more or less advanced over the cornea toward its center.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristics are the constancy of the triangular form,
and the facility with which the whole of it may be taken hold of with a pair of
forceps and raised into a fold on the cornea. Every other kind of excrescence
attached to this membrane continues firmly adherent to it, and can not be
folded and raised from the surface of the cornea in any manner whatever.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Raise the fold and dissect it away from all points of
attachment.</p>

<h4>TRICHIASIS (INVERSION OF THE EYELASHES).</h4>

<p>In the simplest form the eyelashes bend inwardly, touching the eyeball,
causing irritation and simple conjunctivitis. It may be also associated with
entropion.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The offending eyelashes should be cut off or pulled out. In
case the natural growth of the eyelashes is directed inward, an operation
similar to that for entropion becomes necessary.</p>

<h4>ENTROPION (INVERSION OF THE EYELID).</h4>

<p>In inversion of the eyelid the eyelashes soon irritate the anterior face of
the cornea and produce more or less inflammation and opacity. The inversion may
be due to the growth of a tumor within or without the lid, to abscess,
laceration, or injury, causing the lid to lose its natural conformity to the
eyeball, ulcerations, etc. Surgical interference in either case becomes
necessary to restore the lid to its natural direction.</p>

<h4>ECTROPION (EVERSION OF THE EYELID).</h4>

<p>This serves to injure the eye by permitting dust or other foreign substances
to enter the eye and interferes with the natural removal of them.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A delicate surgical operation&mdash;the removal of an
elliptic section of the palpÃ¦bral conjunctiva&mdash;may remedy the defect.</p>

<h4>TUMORS OF THE EYELIDS.</h4>

<p>Occasionally tumors form upon or within the substance of the eyelid. They
may be of a fibroid nature and arise from the follicles of the hair as
sebaceous tumors or may be in the form of an abscess. In debilitating diseases
the lids sometimes become swollen and puffy, a condition which may possibly be
taken for the growth of a tumor. This generally disappears with the improvement
of the health of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">
[Pg 351]</a></span>animal. Warts not uncommonly appear on or about the
eyelids of cattle.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The removal of a tumor in the vicinity of so delicate an
organ as the eye should not be attempted by anyone not qualified to perform the
operation.</p>

<h4>LACERATION OF THE EYELID.</h4>

<p>This accident is not uncommon where cattle are fenced in by barbed wire; an
animal may be caught under the eyelid by the horn of another, or the laceration
may occur in the stable by means of a projecting nail or splinter of wood.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The edges of the wound should be brought together closely
and correctly, by means of pins pushed through very nearly the whole thickness
of the lid, extending through each lip of the torn part; then a waxed silk or
linen thread must be wound over each end of the pin, crossing the torn line in
the form of the figure 8 (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII</a>, fig. 9); the
pins should be placed about three-eighths of an inch apart. The projecting ends
of the pins should be cut off close to the ligature, and the parts kept
anointed with vaseline, to which 2 per cent of compound cresol has been added.
In place of a pin suture, silver wire, catgut, or strong linen thread may be
used in the way of an ordinary suture.</p>

<h4>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE.</h4>

<p>Splinters of wood, hedge thorns, pieces of cornstalk or leaves, stems of hay
or straw, twigs of trees, or weeds may penetrate into the eye, break off, and
remain, causing inflammation, blindness, abscess, etc. These substances may
penetrate the eyeball, but more frequently they glide off and enter between the
eye and the ocular sheath.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Their removal becomes often a very difficult task, from the
fact that the organ is so extremely sensitive, and the retracting power so
strong as to necessitate casting the animal, or even the administration of
sufficient chloroform to render it completely insensible. The removal, however,
is of paramount importance, and the after treatment depends upon the extent and
location of the injury&mdash;cold water compress over the injured eye, the
application of mild astringent and cooling washes, such as acetate or sulphate
of zinc, 5 grains to the ounce of water. When there is extreme suffering from
pain a solution of atropia or morphia, 5 grains to the ounce of water, may be
dropped into the eye, alternating with the cooling wash several times a day.
When abscesses form within the orbit a free opening must be maintained for the
discharge of pus. In deep penetrating wounds of the eye there is a great
tendency to the formation of a fungous growth, which often necessitates the
enucleation of the whole eyeball.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>ORBITAL AND PERIORBITAL ABSCESS.</h4>

<p>Orbital abscess may form outside the globe and within the orbital
sheath, as the result of a previous wound of the parts or from fracture of the
bony orbit, etc. Periorbital abscess commences outside the ocular sheath,
beneath the periosteal membrane covering the bone, and is usually the result of
a disease or fractured bone which enters into the formation of the orbital
cavity.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Orbital abscess is manifested by a pushing forward of the
eyeball (exophthalmos), a swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids. The bulging
out of the eye is in proportion to the size of the abscess; the movement of the
eye is fixed, due to the painfulness of any voluntary movement of the eyeball.
Periorbital abscess generally pushes the eye to one side; otherwise the
symptoms are similar to the foregoing. The pain generally is very great;
paralysis of the nerve of sight may occur, and death may be caused by the
abscess extending to the brain.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment for either orbital or periorbital abscess is
the same as that for abscess occurring in any other part of the body&mdash;a
free opening for the escape of imprisoned pus. This should be made as soon as
the true nature of the disease is recognized. Afterwards antiseptic injections
may be needed to stimulate healthy granulation and to prevent septic infection
of the ocular membranes. For this purpose a saturated solution of boric acid or
listerine 1 part to 10 of water may be used. When the fever runs high,
Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda) may be given in 4-ounce doses once a day. The
animal should be kept in a darkened stable, on soft or green feed.</p>

<h4>FRACTURE OF THE ORBIT.</h4>

<p>This accident occasionally occurs among belligerent animals, or as the
result of blows delivered by brutal attendants. The orbital process above the
eye may be entirely crushed in, pressing down upon the eyeball. In such an
event the depressed bone should be elevated into its proper place, and if it
fails to unite it may have to be removed with saw or chisel. The margin of the
orbit may be crushed at any point and cause periorbital abscess, or necrosis
may result from the presence of a splinter of bone or the excessive destruction
of bone. In all cases of fracture the animal should be kept by itself until the
injured part heals.</p>

<h4>NECROSIS OF THE BONY ORBIT.</h4>

<p>As the result of fracture of the margin of the orbit a part of the injured
bone may become necrosed (dead), and periostitis and periorbital abscess will
follow as a consequence. The discovery of this disease will at first resemble
abscess, but on making an examination with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353"
id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>a probe after the abscess is open we
find the bone rough and brittle at the point of disease. The discharge has a
peculiar fetid odor, and is often mixed with blood.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The affected bone must be laid bare and all diseased
portions removed by scraping or, if necessary, with saw or chisel, disregarding
the extent of the injury or the size of the wound necessary to be inflicted. A
large portion of the bony orbit may be removed without serious danger to the
eye, provided the eyeball itself has not been previously affected by
the disease or involved in the original injury.</p>

<h4>TUMORS OF THE ORBIT.</h4>

<p>A fungous tumor of the eyeball or orbit occasionally appears, which is
designated fungus hÃ¦matodes. This may arise without any appreciable cause, or
as the result of a wound. It frequently commences within the eyeball as a
small, red mass, eventually bursts through, and pushes its way outside the
orbit as a large, dark-red mass, bleeding at the slightest touch. It has a
peculiar, fetid odor, and early in its appearance destroys sight, involving all
the contents of the orbit, not infrequently the bony wall itself.</p>

<p>Unless the tumor is totally removed in its early stage of growth, together
with the eyeball, the disease will eventually cause emaciation and death of the
animal. The enucleation of the eyeball should not be undertaken by anyone
unacquainted with the anatomical structures involved in such an operation. When
the operation is performed early enough the result is generally
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Bony tumors of the orbit, the result of bruises, fractures, etc., are
occasionally present in cattle. They may encroach upon the contents of the
orbit, causing paralysis of the optic nerve&mdash;the condition known as
amaurosis&mdash;or by pressure upon the posterior surface of the eyeball force
it forward, or produce atrophy (shrinking). They may displace the eye in any
direction, with or without disturbing vision.</p>

<p>Fibrous tumors growing within the orbit will produce symptoms similar to
those of bony tumors.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When the outlines of the tumor, whether fungoid, bony, or
fibrous, can be detected, an operation for its removal should be undertaken as
soon as the sight of the eye is in any manner disturbed.</p>

<h4>DISLOCATION OF THE EYEBALL.</h4>

<p>The eyeball may be torn out of its socket by the horns of another animal, or
it may be crowded out with the blunt end of a club, cane, or probe in the hands
of a brutal attendant.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;When the optic nerve is not lacerated and the
retractor muscles at the back of the eye are intact, an attempt at reduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>is
advisable. This, however, must follow very soon after the injury&mdash;before
swelling takes place. Divide the outer corner of the eyelid to enlarge the
orifice, then by pressure with the fingers of both hands placed upon the sides
of the eye the ball may be put into its place. Apply a firm compress over the
injured eye and keep it constantly wet with cold water containing 1 dram of
sugar of lead to each quart.</p>

<p>If the attempt at reduction proves unsuccessful the artery at the back of
the eye should be ligated, and then the whole mass cut off as deep within the
orbit as possible. The orbital cavity, after washing it out with a 3 per cent
solution of carbolic acid or compound cresol, should be packed daily with fresh
absorbent cotton.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE HAW.</h4>

<p>The haw, or membrana nictitans, is subject to inflammation and swelling from
the extension of conjunctivitis, or direct injury by foreign substances. It
presents a red, swollen appearance, accompanied with considerable pain and a
profuse flow of tears. A slight scarification with a sharp knife and the
application of a cooling lotion, such as is recommended for conjunctivitis,
will soon reduce the swelling and restore it to its normal function.</p>

<p>There is, however, a tendency for an inflammation of this membrane to take
on a chronic character, which may eventually result in a permanent enlargement,
resembling a tumor. When it attains sufficient size to protrude itself
permanently over the eye, or project between the lids so as to obstruct the
sight, its removal may become necessary. A threaded needle is passed through
the body of the enlarged mass, by which the membrane is drawn out as far as
possible, then with a blunt pair of scissors it may be dissected away from its
attachments. The eye is afterwards treated with simple cooling lotions.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASES_OF_THE_EAR" id="DISEASES_OF_THE_EAR"></a>DISEASES OF THE
EAR.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">M. R. Trumbower, D. V. S.</span></h3>

<h5>[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]</h5>

<p>Diseases of the ears of cattle are not very common, for the reasons probably
that they are not subjected to the brutality of drivers so much as horses and
that the horns to a great extent protect them against external violence.</p>

<h4>OTITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE INTERNAL EAR).</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the deep part of the ear is often difficult to recognize in
cattle. It may be caused by disease of bone in that region, from blows
inflicted by drivers, or from injury by other cattle. Occasionally the ear
becomes involved in actinomycosis (lumpy jaw), or the inflammation may be the
result of a tuberculous affection.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The animal will hold its head to one side, or shake it,
while the ear itself is held immovable. The movement of the jaws in eating
usually gives rise to a manifestation of pain; the base of the ear may be
feverish and swollen, and very sensitive to the touch. If the inflammation has
advanced to a suppurative stage, offensive matter will flow from the ear.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;At first, hot fomentations to reduce pain and fever,
followed by a sharp blister below the ear. Laudanum, 1 part to 10 of sweet oil,
may be injected into the ear to relieve pain and to soften the secretions. If
there is a discharge from the ear, it should be thoroughly washed out by
injecting warm soapsuds until all the matter has been washed away; then inject
the following mixture twice a day: Sulphate of morphia, 20 grains; water, 1
pint; glycerin, 4 ounces.</p>

<h4>ABSCESS.</h4>

<p>Abscesses, caused by contusions, sometimes form about the base of the ear,
either inside or outside. A serous cyst is found occasionally between the
cartilage and the skin on the base of the ear, which may be from a similar
cause.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;With the knife make a free incision into the most prominent
part of the abscess or cyst, then, with a syringe, wash out the sac with
carbolized water. If the abscess recurs, open it again, wash it out, and inject
tincture of iodin, or fill it with iodoform.</p>

<h4>FUNGOID GROWTHS.</h4>

<p>As a result of laceration or wound of any kind, fungous growths,
characterized by a raw, bleeding, granulating surface, with a tendency to
become pendulous, may develop on the ear.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The whole tumor or diseased structure should be cut away,
and the wound treated daily with a dressing of carbolized cosmoline or
turpentine and sweet oil, 1 part of the former to 4 of the latter.</p>

<h4>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR.</h4>

<p>Bugs have been known to gain entrance into the ears of animals. I once
removed an acorn from the ear of a cow that had been roaming in the woods; also
pieces of wood from a stanchion may be lodged accidentally in the ear.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;There is usually a continuous uneasiness or frequent shaking
of the head, occasionally the manifestation of exceedingly great pain. The
animal may rub the head and ear against trees or other objects in an endeavor
to dislodge the offending body.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A careful examination reveals the cause, which may be
removed with a pair of forceps or scraped out with a hairpin or piece of wire
bent at one end. If much inflammation exists, the ear may be swollen so that
the foreign substance is hidden from sight; then a probe may be inserted to
feel for the object, which, when found, should be removed, even if it becomes
necessary to split the ear at the base. Afterwards treat the ear with frequent
warm water fomentations and the injection of soapy water or oil and water.</p>

<h4>SCURFY EARS.</h4>

<p>Cattle are subject to scurfy ears, which may be owing to a generally morbid
condition of the skin, or may be confined to the ears alone. The affected
animal shows an inclination to rub the ear; thick scales, which sometimes have
the appearance of hard, dry, horny scales, of scurf collect on it. This
condition is chiefly caused by a faulty secretion of the sebaceous glands of
the ear. Thoroughly clean the ear with a stiff brush, then anoint it, so far as
affected, with vaseline 4 parts to 1 part of white precipitate ointment. If the
scurfy ears are only a part of a general scurfiness of the skin, the condition
of the animal needs attention. (See "Pityriasis," <a href="#Page_329">p. 329</a>.)</p>

<h4>FROSTBITE.</h4>

<p>It is not uncommon among young cattle which are poorly nourished and exposed
outdoors to storms and extreme cold to suffer frostbite of the ear, which may
constitute actual freezing of the part.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Frostbite presents naturally every degree of severity from
the mere chilling of the tip of the ear to positive freezing and death of a
portion. In a day or two after the freezing has occurred the ear becomes
swollen and very painful; the dead part remains cold and begins to shrivel; a
line of separation then forms between <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357"
id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>the inflamed and the dead or dying
portion, and finally the piece destroyed drops off, leaving a raw healing
surface. When the ear is only slightly affected by the cold, an excoriation or
peeling off of superficial skin takes place, accompanied with some pain and
itching.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;A good liniment for frozen ears is a mixture of turpentine,
ammonia, and chloroform, of each 1 part, added to 6 parts of sweet oil. Rub
this on the ear several times a day. It will relieve pain and stimulate the
circulation, thus favoring a recovery of the injured structures.</p>

<h4>LACERATIONS OF THE EAR.</h4>

<p>Aggressive dogs are the most frequent cause of lacerated ear, generally
leaving a torn, ragged edge and bruised cartilage.</p>

<p>If the wound is extensive, a trimming of the ragged edges becomes necessary;
then the edges should be fastened together with silver wire, catgut, or strong,
thick, linen thread, taking a deep hold, and pine tar applied.</p>

<h4>DISEASE OF THE CARTILAGE AND NECROSIS.</h4>

<p>Occasionally the cartilages of the ear become affected, usually the result
of a deep bruise; pus forms, burrows under the skin, and may find a discharge
from any part of the ear more or less distant from the seat of the disease.
When the cartilage has been extensively injured, pieces of it may become dead
(necrosed) and dissolve, to be carried away with the pus, or it may lead to
extensive sloughing and the formation of numerous running sores. In the disease
of the cartilage there is seldom much swelling or great pain. The discharge is
usually very offensive, and occasionally streaked with blood. Whenever there is
a long-continued, persistent discharge from one or more openings in the ear,
disease of the cartilage may be suspected.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The sinus formed by the passage of matter should be probed
and searched to the bottom for the presence of a foreign substance or the
evidence of decaying cartilage. When the probe touches necrosed cartilage it
will feel like a piece of dry leather or partially softened wood. A counter
opening must then be made at this place, and all diseased cartilage cut away
with the knife. The subsequent treatment consists in keeping the artificial
wound open for the discharge of pus, and the injection of chlorid of zinc, 5
grains to the ounce of water, once or twice a day, until the wound is
healed.</p>

<h4>ENCHONDROMA OF THE EAR.</h4>

<p>This is an excessive growth of cartilage, found at the base of the ear in
the form of a hard, painless tumor, firmly attached to the movable ear. The
only recourse for its removal is the knife in the hands of one acquainted with
the anatomy of the part involved in the operation.</p>

<h2><a name="INFECTIOUS_DISEASES_OF_CATTLE"
id="INFECTIOUS_DISEASES_OF_CATTLE"></a>INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF CATTLE.</h2>

<h5>Revised by John R. Mohler, A. M., V. M. D.,</h5>

<h5><em>Chief, Bureau of Animal Industry</em>.</h5>

<h4>GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>The importance, to the farmer and stock raiser, of a general knowledge of
the nature of infectious diseases need not be insisted on, as it must be
evident to all who have charge of farm animals. The growing
facilities for intercourse between one section of a country and another, and
between different countries, cause a wide distribution of the infectious
diseases once restricted to a definite locality. Not only the animals
themselves, but the cars, vessels, or other conveyances in which they are
carried may become agents for the dissemination of disease. The growing
tendency of specialization in agriculture, which leads to the maintenance of
large herds of cattle, sheep, and hogs, makes infectious diseases more common
and more dangerous. Fresh animals are being continually introduced which may be
the carriers of disease from other herds, and when disease is once brought into
a large herd the losses become very high, because it is difficult, if not
impossible, to check it after it has once obtained a foothold.</p>

<p>These considerations make it plain that only by the most careful supervision
by intelligent men who understand the nature of infectious diseases and their
causes in a general way can these be kept away. We must likewise consider how
incomplete our knowledge concerning many diseases is, and probably will be for
some time to come. The suggestions and recommendations offered by
investigators, therefore, may not always be correct, and may require frequent
modification as our information grows more comprehensive and exact.</p>

<p>An infectious disease may be defined as any malady caused by the
introduction, into the body, of minute organisms of a vegetable or animal
nature which have the power of indefinite multiplication and of setting free
certain peculiar poisons which are chiefly responsible for the morbid
changes.</p>

<p>This definition might include diseases caused by certain animal parasites,
such as trichinÃ¦, for example, which multiply in the digestive tract, but whose
progeny is limited to a single generation. By common consent the term
"infectious" is restricted to those diseases <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359"
id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>caused by the invasion and multiplication of
certain very minute unicellular organisms included under the general classes
of bacteria and protozoa. Nearly all the diseases of cattle for which a definite
cause has been traced are from bacteria. Among these are tuberculosis, anthrax,
blackleg, and tetanus (or lockjaw). Some diseases, such as Texas fever and
nagana, are traceable to protozoa, while others, like vactinomycosis and
aspergillosis, are caused by fungi. Those diseases of which the cause is
unknown or imperfectly worked out are pleuropneumonia, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth
disease, rabies, cowpox, malignant catarrh, and dysentery.</p>

<p>Bacteria may be defined as very minute, unicellular organisms of a plantlike
character. Their form is very simple, as may be seen from an inspection of the
various species depicted on <a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Plate XXVIII</a>. The description of these figures will
be found on <a href="#Page_360">page 360</a>. The magnification there given will furnish the reader
some idea of their very minute size. They multiply in two ways. The bacterium
elongates and then divides in the middle to form 2 daughter cells.
These go through the same process at once, and thus 4 cells are produced. The
division of these leads to 8, the division of 8 to 16, and so on indefinitely.
The rapidity with which this multiplication takes place depends upon the nature
of the bacterium. The bacillus of tuberculosis multiplies very slowly, while
that of anthrax does so with great rapidity, provided both are in the most
favorable condition. Another mode of reproduction, limited to certain classes
of bacteria, consists in the formation of a spore within the body of the
bacterium. Spore formation usually takes place when the conditions pertaining
to the growth of the bacteria become unfavorable. The spores are much more
resistant to destructive agents than the bacteria which produced them. The
anthrax spore may live several years in a dried state, but the anthrax bacillus
perishes in a few days under like conditions. This matter will be referred to
again when we come to discuss the subject of disinfection.</p>

<p>Of the protozoa which cause disease very little is at present known. One
which produces Texas fever is pictured on <a href="#PLATE_XLV">Plate XLV</a>, in figs. 4 and 5. These
parasites have a more complex life history than bacteria; and as they can not
be grown in artificial media, their thorough investigation is at present
hampered with great difficulties.</p>

<p>The differences in the symptoms and lesions of the various infectious
diseases are due to differences in the respective organisms causing them.
Similarly the great differences observed in the sources from which animals
become infected and the manner in which infection takes place are due to
differences in the life history of these minute organisms. Much discussion has
taken place of late years concerning the precise meaning of the words
"infection" and "contagion."</p>

<p>These words, however, are now wholly inadequate to express the complex
processes of infection, and it may be said that each species of bacterium or
protozoon has its own peculiar way of invading the animal body, differing more
or less from all the rest. There are, however, a few broad distinctions which
may be expressed with the help of these old terms. Infection, as laid down
above, refers at present in a comprehensive way to all microorganisms capable
of setting up disease in the body. Some microorganisms are transmitted directly
from one animal to another, and the diseases produced may be called contagious.
Among these are included pleuropneumonia, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease,
rabies, cowpox, and tuberculosis. Again, certain organisms are perhaps never
transmitted from one animal to another, but may come from the soil. Among these
are tetanus, blackleg, anthrax to a large extent, and perhaps actinomycosis in
part. These diseases, according to some authorities, may be called miasmatic.
There is a third class of infectious diseases, the specific bacteria of which
are transmitted from one animal to another, as with the contagious diseases,
but the bacteria may, under certain favorable conditions, find food enough in
the soil and in the surroundings of animals to multiply to some extent after
they have left the sick animal and before they gain entrance into a healthy
one.</p>

<p>This general classification is subject to change if we take other
characteristics into consideration. Thus tuberculosis, because of its insidious
beginning and slow course, would not by many be considered contagious in the
sense that foot-and-mouth disease is; yet, in either case, the bacillus must
come from preexisting disease. The disease of rabies, or hydrophobia, is not
contagious in the sense that rinderpest is, because the virus of rabies must be
inoculated into a wound before it can take effect; yet, in both cases, the
virus passes without modification from one animal to another, though in
different ways.</p>

<p>Again, all the diseases under the second group, which seem to come from the
soil and from pastures, are in one sense contagious in that the virus may be
taken from a sick animal and inoculated directly, with positive results, into a
healthy animal. Other illustrations may be cited which show that these old
terms are not in themselves satisfactory. There are so many conditions which
enter into the process of infection that no single classification will give a
sufficiently correct or comprehensive idea of it. These statements will be
easily understood if the different infectious diseases in the following pages
are studied with reference to the way or ways in which each disease may be
contracted. Enough has been said, therefore, to show that if we wish to make
ourselves acquainted with the dangers of any given <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>disease, we must study it
and not rely upon any single work to tell the whole story.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases have, as a general rule, a period of incubation, which
comprises the time elapsing between the exposure to the infection and the
actual appearance of the disease. This period varies with the malady. The most
common symptom of this class of diseases is fever. The severity of the fever is
measured by the temperature of the animal; this is readily and accurately
ascertainable by the clinical thermometer. (See <a href="#PLATE_III">Pl.
III</a>, fig. 1.) The other symptoms are variable and depend upon the
particular organ or organs most implicated. Loss of appetite, cessation of
rumination and milk secretion, and general dullness are symptoms quite
invariably present in most infectious diseases.</p>

<p>During the course of infectious diseases secondary diseases or complications
may arise which are largely caused by bacteria other than those producing the
original malady. These complications are often so severe as to become fatal. In
general it may be stated that they are due to filthy surroundings, and hence
cleanliness may become an important aid to recovery.</p>

<p>The treatment of infectious diseases is given under each malady so far as
this is allowable or advisable. These diseases are not, as a rule, amenable to
treatment. When the symptoms have once appeared the disease is liable to run
its course in spite of treatment, and if it is one from which animals usually
recover, all that can be done is to put them into the most favorable
surroundings. Many infectious diseases lead sooner or later to death, treatment
is useless so far as the sick are concerned, and it may be worse than useless
for those not yet infected. All animals suffering with infectious diseases are
more or less directly a menace to all others. They represent for the time being
manufactories of disease germs, and they are giving them off more or less
abundantly during the period of disease. They may infect others directly
or they may scatter the virus about, and the surroundings may become a future
source of infection for healthy animals. This leads us to the subject of
prevention as the most important of all which claim our attention. In this
place only a few general remarks will suffice to bring the subject before the
reader.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to keep disease away from a herd or farm. To do
this all sick or suspicious animals should be avoided. A grave form of disease
may be introduced by apparently mild or trivial cases brought in from without.
It is generally conceded that continual change and movement of animals are the
most potent means by which infectious diseases are disseminated.</p>

<p>With some cattle diseases, such as anthrax, rinderpest, and pleuropneumonia,
preventive inoculation is resorted to in some countries. This may be desirable
when certain diseases have become established <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363"
id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> in any locality so that eradication is
impossible. It should not be practiced in territories where a given disease may
still be extirpated by ordinary precautions. Preventive inoculation is applicable
to only a few maladies, and therefore its aid in the control of diseases is
limited.</p>

<p>When an infectious disease has gained foothold in a herd the course to be
pursued will depend upon the nature of the malady. A good rule is to kill
diseased animals, especially when the disease is liable to run a chronic
course, as in tuberculosis. The next important step is to separate the well
from the sick by placing the former on fresh ground. This is rarely possible;
hence the destruction or removal of the sick, with thorough disinfection of the
infected locality, is the next thing to be done. As to the disinfectants to be
used, special directions are given under the various diseases, to which the
reader is referred. Here we will simply call attention briefly to the general
subject.</p>

<h4>DISINFECTION AND DISINFECTANTS.</h4>

<p>Disinfection consists in the use of certain substances which possess the
power to destroy bacteria or their spores, or both. Those which are cheapest
and most available for animal diseases are ordinary freshly slaked lime or
unslaked in powder, chlorid of lime, crude carbolic acid, corrosive sublimate,
formaldehyde gas, formalin, and compound cresol solution.</p>

<p>(1) Slaked lime is perhaps the most easily procured, but its disinfecting
power is limited. While it is capable of destroying all bacteria in their
vegetative state, it is unable to destroy such spores as those of anthrax and
blackleg. It is probable, however, that in incrusting spores it may destroy
their vitality sooner or later. It is regarded as safe practice to use only
spore-destroying substances for the virus of those diseases of which we have no
definite knowledge. Nevertheless, in the absence of other disinfectants, lime
is very useful. It may be employed as a whitewash on wood and stone and
sprinkled as a dilute wash or in powder over yards, manure heaps, and over
carcasses before they are buried, and over the ground on which they have lain
to prevent other animals from carrying the infection away.</p>

<p>(2) Chlorid of lime is more efficient than simple slaked or unslaked lime,
as it destroys spores. It is the ordinary bleaching powder of commerce and is
quite unstable, hence old preparations, unless sealed, are of little value. A 5
per cent solution is sufficiently strong for all spore-bearing bacteria (3
ounces in 2 quarts of water). It may be efficiently applied to the walls and
floor of an infected stable by mixing with limewash in the proportion of 6
ounces of the lime to each gallon of limewash. The ceilings and those portions
of the walls which can not be reached should be disinfected by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
chlorin gas liberated from the chlorid of lime by crude carbolic acid. This is
accomplished by making a cone of 5 or 6 pounds of chlorid of lime, in the top
of which a deep crater is made for the placement of from 1 to 2 pints of crude
acid. The edge of the crater is thereupon pushed into the fluid, when a lively
reaction follows. The fumes of chlorin are strongly irritating to the
respiratory tract and therefore all live stock should be removed before the
work is started. Owing to the heat generated, it is advisable to place the lime
in an iron crucible and to have nothing inflammable within a radius of 2 feet.
The number and location of these cones of chlorid of lime depend on the size
and structure of the building to be disinfected. As a rule, it may be stated
that chlorin gas liberated from the above-sized cone will be sufficient for
disinfecting 5,200 cubic feet of air space.</p>

<p>(3) Crude carbolic acid. The ordinary purified carbolic acid is too
expensive to be used on a large scale, and the crude produce is a very good
substitute. This is made more powerful by mixing with it an equal volume of
commercial sulphuric acid. While the sulphuric acid is being added to the crude
carbolic acid much heat is evolved, and if the glass jar in which the two are
mixed is placed in cold water the resulting product is said to have a higher
disinfecting power. The mixture is added to water enough to make a 5 per cent
solution (about 7 ounces to 4 quarts of water). This is strong enough for all
purposes. It may be kept in wood or glass, but not in metal, owing to the
corroding action of the acid. It should be used freely on woodwork and on
infected floors, and a force pump of the kind used by orchardists is very
convenient as a means of applying the disinfectant. If the solution is warm
when applied, it will penetrate the woodwork better than when cold, especially
if the spraying is done during cold weather. The addition of air-slaked lime in
any quantity that will dissolve in water to the above solution (say 1&frac12;
pounds of lime to 7 ounces of crude carbolic acid to each gallon of water) is
preferred by many, as it makes any neglected places at once visible and leaves
cleaner and better air within the buildings. In most cases in which its
application becomes desirable&mdash;and this rule should apply to all
disinfections&mdash;the disinfected stables, stalls, etc., should remain vacant
as long as possible before cattle are again stabled therein.</p>

<p>(4) Mercuric chlorid, or corrosive sublimate, is a powerful disinfectant,
but it is likewise very poisonous; hence its uses are limited. Cattle are
especially susceptible to its action and caution must be used in its application.
A solution of one-tenth of 1 per cent is usually sufficient (1 ounce to 8
gallons of water). It should not be placed in wooden pails, which would
form the tannate of mercury, a weak antiseptic; nor, owing to its corrosive
action, should expen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">
[Pg 365]</a></span>sive metal pails be used. Agate vessels or tin pails are
to be preferred. All solutions should be labeled "poison," and to avoid
accidents none should be kept on hand.</p>

<p>(5) Formalin and formaldehyde gas have been found very efficacious as
sanitary agents. Formalin is the commercial name for the 40 per cent solution
of formaldehyde gas in water, and is one of the most powerful antiseptic and
disinfectants that we possess. Solutions of this strength are manufactured by
different commercial houses and sold by the drug trade under the name of
"formalose" and "formal." In this connection it should be mentioned that while
the 40 per cent solution of formaldehyde gas and formalin are exactly the same
thing, the former can be purchased at 33-1/3 to 64 per cent less than the
latter. Formalin, diluted with water in the proportion of 1 pint to 30 parts of
water, or 4 ounces to each gallon of water, may be applied, and it may thus be
used as a wash or as a spray on all paints, metals, and woodwork, as well as on
clothing and other fabrics, without injuring them. It may also be applied to
floors, walls, and woodwork in whitewash by mixing 1 part to 30 parts of
limewash, or 4 ounces to each gallon of limewash. Formalin has the appearance
of water and in the strong solution is poisonous, but when diluted as
recommended above it is not dangerous. The fumes given off by it, however, are
very disagreeable and irritating to the eyes and nasal mucous membranes. One
and one-half ounces of formalin added to 1 gallon of water is a valuable agent
for the disinfection of the skin or septic wounds, but is somewhat painful and
irritating to raw surfaces.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is a gas which is soluble in 2&frac12; parts of water (40 parts of
formaldehyde gas to 100 parts of water); this solution constitutes the formalin
of commerce. The use of formaldehyde gas is in most cases impracticable for
stable disinfection. In case the stable is not too large and can be made almost
air-tight the generation of formaldehyde gas, after removing all the animals,
will be found very serviceable. It penetrates all parts of the stable&mdash;the
walls, crevices, floors, ceiling&mdash;and is probably the best fumigating
disinfectant that we have.</p>

<p>Probably one of the most simple and practical methods of liberating this gas
is by means of the chemical reaction which takes place when formalin is poured
upon permanganate of potassium. For each 1,000 cubic feet of air space, 16-2/3
ounces of crystallized or powdered permanganate of potassium is placed in a
wide-surfaced pan; 20 ounces of formalin is then poured upon it, and the stable
immediately closed for a period of 12 hours or longer. This method is efficient
only when it is possible to seal tightly the place to be disinfected, and
should be used only by experienced persons.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
</p>

<p>(6) Some coal-tar products are cheap, effective, and easily applied
disinfectants, their action being due to the carbolic acid and creosote in
their composition. They may be used in 3 to 5 per cent solution. As a rule
they form a milky solution in water.</p>

<p>(7) Compound solution of cresol (liquor cresolis compositus), now recognized
as an official preparation, is composed of equal parts of cresol and
linseed-oil-potash soap. The mixture is a thick, dark, amber-colored fluid
which mixes readily with water in all proportions to form a clear, soap
solution. It is an efficient disinfectant in a 3 or 4 per cent solution, and in
this strength it may be applied in the same manner as a 5 per cent solution of
carbolic acid.</p>

<p>When it is desired to apply one of these above-mentioned agents to the
stable or barnyard, a preliminary cleaning up of all dÃ©bris and litter is
advisable, together with the scraping of the floor, mangers, and walls of the
stable with hoes; also the removal of all dust and filth. This should be
followed by the burning of all such accumulations, inasmuch as this material
likewise contains the infectious principle and is best destroyed by heat. Heat
may be applied to the surface of the affected pen, byre, or barnyard by means
of a cyclone burner, which consists of a tank, pump, hose, and cyclone nozzle
for spraying with paraffin (gas oil). The latter is ejected in the form of
spray, which when ignited gives a very hot and effective flame to be applied to
the infected ground. Where such burning is impracticable the surface soil of
the yard and surroundings should be removed to a depth of 5 or 6 inches and
then placed in a heap and thoroughly mixed with air-slaked lime. The fresh
surface of the soil thus exposed may then be sprinkled with the
disinfectant.</p>

<p>In addition to these artificial substances there are several natural
sanitary agents of great importance as destroyers of virus. These are
cleanliness, ventilation, drying, and sunshine. All virus, excepting such as
may live in the soil, is killed sooner or later by drying and sunshine, and the
importance of these factors in the daily life of animals need not be insisted
on here. Finally, all sanitary measures which contribute to the healthfulness
of animal surroundings are directly or indirectly inimical to disease germs,
and all carelessness in the keeping of animals may be regarded as an ally of
these destructive organisms.</p>

<h4>CONTAGIOUS PLEUROPNEUMONIA.</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XXIX">Pls.&nbsp;XXIX</a>-<a href="#PLATE_XXXII">XXXII</a>.]</h5>

<p><em>Definition and history</em>.&mdash;This disease has been eradicated from the
United States, and it is not probable that it will ever be seen in this country
again. As, however, much interest was manifested in regard <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> to it for a number
of years, and as our cattle are still prohibited from some foreign markets on
account of its previous existence here, the subject is treated at greater
length than would otherwise be necessary.</p>

<p>The contagious pleuropneumonia of cattle is a specific, epizootic disease
which affects bovine animals, and from which other species are exempt. It is
characterized, when the disease results from exposure in the usual
manner, by an inflammation of the lungs and pleurÃ¦, which is generally
extensive, and which has a tendency to invade portions of these organs not
primarily affected and to cause death of the diseased portion of the lung. This
disease is frequently called the lung plague, which corresponds to its German
name of Lungenseuche. In French it is spoken of as the pÃ©ripneumonie
contagieuse.</p>

<p>The history of the contagious pleuropneumonia of cattle can not be traced
with any certainty to a period earlier than the beginning of the eighteenth
century. No doubt it existed and ravaged the herds of Europe for many years and
perhaps centuries before that time, but veterinary knowledge was so limited
that the descriptions of the symptoms and post-mortem appearance are too vague
and too limited to admit of the identification of the maladies to which they
refer. It has been supposed by some writers that certain passages in the
writings of Aristotle, Livy, and Virgil show the existence of pleuropneumonia
at the time that their works were composed, but their references are too
indefinite to be seriously accepted as indicating this rather than some other
disease.</p>

<p>It seems quite plain that as early as 1713 and 1714 pleuropneumonia existed
in Swabia and several Cantons of Switzerland. There are even clearer accounts
of its prevalence in Switzerland in 1732, 1743, and 1765. In 1769 a disease
called murie was investigated in Franche-ComtÃ© by Bourgelat which undoubtedly
was identical with the pleuropneumonia of to-day. From that period we have
frequent and well-authenticated accounts of its existence in various parts of
Europe. During the period from 1790 to 1812 it was spread throughout a large
portion of the Continent of Europe by the cattle driven for the subsistence of
the armies, which marched and countermarched in all directions. It was
generally prevalent in Italy in 1800. It appears to have been unknown, however,
in the Department of the Nord, France, until 1826, but during the years from
1820 to 1840 it penetrated into most parts of that country. During the same
period it was introduced into and allowed to spread over Belgium and
Holland.</p>

<p>This contagion is said to have been carried to Ireland from Holland in 1839,
and is reported as existing in England in 1842. The disease was brought to the
United States at several different times. Probably its first introduction was
with a diseased cow sold in Brook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368"
id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>lyn, N. Y., in 1843. It came to New Jersey by
importing affected animals in 1847. Massachusetts was infected in the same way
in 1859.</p>

<p>South Africa was infected by a bull brought from Holland in 1854, and
Australia likewise received the contagion with an English cow in 1858. It is
also reported as existing in various parts of the Continent of Asia, but the
time of its first appearance and the extent of its distribution are very
uncertain.</p>

<p>Some countries, such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which had been infected
for only a short time, have succeeded in eradicating the disease without much
difficulty by slaughtering all affected and exposed animals. Other countries
long infected and in which the contagion was thoroughly established, like
Australia, South Africa, Italy, France, Belgium, and parts of Germany, have
labored long, in some cases making no progress and in others being only
partially successful. Holland was one of the first of the thoroughly infected
countries to free itself from the contagion.</p>

<p>In the United States, Massachusetts eradicated pleuropneumonia during the
period from 1860 to 1866. New York and New Jersey made an attempt to eradicate
it in 1879, but were not successful. Late in 1883 the contagion was carried to
Ohio, probably by Jersey cattle purchased in the vicinity of Baltimore, Md., to
which place it had extended before 1868. From the herd then infected it was
spread by the sale of cattle during 1884 to a limited number of herds in
Illinois, to one herd in Missouri, and to two in Kentucky. The alarm caused
among the stock owners of the United States by this widespread dissemination of
a disease so much dreaded led to the adoption of active measures for its
control and eradication. By cooperation between the United States Department of
Agriculture and the authorities of the affected States it was found possible to
prevent the further spread of the contagion and to eradicate it after a few
months' delay.</p>

<p>In 1886 pleuropneumonia was discovered in some of the large distillery
stables of Chicago and among cows on neighboring lots. This led to renewed
efforts for the complete extirpation of this disease from the country. Congress
in 1887 enlarged the appropriation available for this purpose and gave more
extended authority. During the same year the disease was stamped out of
Chicago, and has not since appeared in any district west of the Allegheny
Mountains.</p>

<p>The work of eradication was at the same time commenced in all the infected
States. Before the end of the year 1889 Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, the
District of Columbia, and Virginia had been freed from the disease. More
difficulties, however, were encountered in the States of New York and New
Jersey, on account of the larger territory infected and the density of the
population. The long struggle was successful, however, and the last animal in
which the disease appeared in the State of New York was slaughtered early in
1891, and the last one affected in New Jersey met the same fate early in the
spring of 1892.</p>

<p>During these same years a supreme effort had been made to stamp out this
lung plague from Great Britain. From the official reports it appears that the
number of infected districts and of diseased animals had rapidly diminished,
but it was not until 1898 that the infection was finally eradicated.</p>

<p>The other infected European countries, though they maintain a veterinary
sanitary service, are not making satisfactory progress in eradicating the
disease. This is owing partly to delays in carrying out the provisions of the
laws and partly to mistaken ideas as to the measures which are necessary to
accomplish the object. The United States was the last of the countries having
old infected districts which undertook to stamp out this contagion, and, except
Holland, it was the first to reach success.</p>

<p><em>The cause (etiology) of pleuropneumonia</em>.&mdash;This is a contagious disease,
and arises only by contagion from a previously affected animal; consequently it
can never be seen here except as the result of importing affected animals from
the Old World. When thoroughly stamped out it does not reappear; and if
imported animals continue to be properly inspected and quarantined, we have
every reason to believe that pleuropneumonia will never again be seen in this
country.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the virus or contagion of lung plague has never been
determined. Various investigators have from time to time claimed
the discovery of the specific organism of the disease, but it was not until
1898 that Nocard and Roux, by an ingenious method of cultivation, succeeded in
obtaining a very feeble growth of an exceedingly minute microorganism. With
these cultures the disease was produced in cattle.</p>

<p>Some investigators and writers are of the opinion that the disease can be
contracted only by an animal coming near enough to a living diseased one to
receive the contagion directly from it. They hold that the contagion is expired
with the air from the affected lungs, and that it must be almost immediately
inspired by another animal in order to produce the disease. Some experimental
attempts to infect animals by placing them in stables where diseased animals
have been, and by placing the diseased lungs of slaughtered animals in their
feeding troughs have failed, and, consequently, apparently confirm this
view.</p>

In the majority of the lungs examined in the laboratory of the bureau which
were affected with contagious pleuropneumonia the principal lobes (<em>a</em>, <em>a'</em>) were
primarily affected.</p>

affected with collapse and beginning bronchopneumonia. The light yellowish
portions represent healthy lung tissue; the red represents the disease. It will
be noticed that the lines between the lobules are quite faint, indicating
little or no inflammation of the connective tissue between the lobules. The
healthy lung tissue is seen to be raised above the level of the diseased
portion. In contagious pleuropneumonia the exact reverse is the case, the
diseased portions being very much larger than the healthy.</p>

<p class="dop2">Fig. 1. Transverse section through the right principal lobe in a case of
acute pleuropneumonia. The area drawn includes the air tubes, veins, and

arteries: <em>a</em>, air tube cut obliquely; <em>a'</em>, air tube cut directly across; <em>b</em>,
arteries cut across; <em>c</em>, large vein completely occluded by a thrombus or plug
formed during life. The great thickening of the walls of the artery and vein in
this disease is especially brought out by stating that in the healthy lung they
are so thin as to be easily overlooked.</p>

pleuropneumonia, illustrating the different kinds of hepatization or
consolidation of the lung. These are indicated by the different colors
from dark red to reddish yellow. This variation of color is regarded by some as
the real marbling characteristic of pleuropneumonia, while the whitish bands
penetrating the lung tissue in all directions constitute the true marbling
according to other observers.</p>

infarctions. The right half of the figure shows nearly normal lung tissue. The
left represents a blackish mass, in which the lung tissue is filled with blood
and solidified. This is caused by the plugging of the vein carrying away the
blood from this portion. The heart forces the blood through the artery into the
tissue at considerable pressure, but owing to the fact that its return is
prevented, the minute blood vessels rupture and the air vesicles become
distended with blood, which coagulates and causes the firmness of the
tissue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is known that the serum from affected lungs retains
its virulence and may be used successfully for inoculation weeks or months
after the death of the animal from which it was taken. This is particularly the
case when this liquid is hermetically sealed in glass tubes. Other
investigators state that they have successfully infected cattle by placing, in
the nostrils, sponges or pledgets of cotton saturated with such serum. Cattle
have also, according to the best evidence obtainable, been infected from the
clothing of attendants, from horns used in drenching, and from smelling about
wagons which have been used to transport affected carcasses. In the work of
eradicating pleuropneumonia from the United States many stables were found in
which the disease would appear and reappear after the slaughter of affected
herds, and in spite of any precautions which were adopted. These were always
old stables, with woodwork in a decaying condition and with floors underlaid
with filth which could not be thoroughly removed or disinfected. In every one
of these cases the destruction of the stable, the burning of the lumber of
which it was constructed, the removal of the accumulations beneath the floors,
and thorough disinfection, prevented the recurrence of the plague in new
stables built upon the same premises. This experience conclusively shows that
under certain conditions, at least, stables may retain the infection for a
considerable time, and that when restocked the disease may break out again from
such infection.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, the disease is acquired by a healthy animal being near
an affected one and receiving the contagion direct. Affected animals may give
off the contagion in the early stages of the disease before the symptoms are
apparent to the observer; also, they may retain this infectious character, if
they survive the attack, for six months and probably for a year after all
symptoms of the disease have disappeared.</p>

<p><em>Incubation</em>.&mdash;The time which elapses between exposure to the contagion
of pleuropneumonia and the first appearance of the symptoms of this disease
varies greatly with different individuals and with different outbreaks of the
disease. Ordinarily the symptoms of disease make their appearance within three
to six weeks after exposure; they may be observed, however, within two weeks or
they may not become apparent until nearly or quite three months. It is this
long period of incubation and the great length of time that an animal may
disseminate the contagion after apparent recovery which give the plague that
insidious character so often spoken of, and which greatly increase the
difficulties of eradication.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms are such as would be expected with inflammation of
the lungs and pleurÃ¦, but they vary considerably, according to the type which
the disease manifests. If the attack is an acute one, as is frequently seen in
hot weather, the symptoms appear suddenly; the breathing becomes rapid and
difficult, the animal grunts or moans with each expiration, the shoulders stand
out from the chest, the head is extended on the neck, the back is arched,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>the
temperature is 104Â° to 107Â° F., the milk secretion is suspended, there is no
appetite, rumination is stopped, the animal may bloat and later be affected
with a severe diarrhea. Such cases are generally fatal in 7 to 20 days.</p>

<p>Very often the attack comes on slowly and the symptoms are much less clear.
In the mildest cases there is a cough for a week or two, but no appreciable
loss of appetite or elevation of temperature. The lungs are but slightly
affected and recovery soon follows. Such animals may disseminate the contagion
for a long time without being suspected, and for that reason are the most
dangerous of all.</p>

<p>A more severe type of the plague is the most frequently seen. In these cases
the cough is frequent, more or less painful, the back somewhat arched, and the
milk secretion diminished. The prominence of these symptoms increases, the
appetite is affected, the animal loses flesh, the breathing becomes more rapid,
the cough more painful, pressure of the fingers between the ribs shows
tenderness, the hair loses its gloss and stands erect, the skin becomes
adherent, little, if any, milk is secreted, and the temperature rises, varying
in different animals from 103Â° to 107Â° F. Animals thus affected may continue to
grow worse and die in from three to eight weeks, or they may after a time begin
to improve and make an apparent recovery. The inflammation of the lung does
not, as a rule, subside and the organ return to its normal condition, as is the
case in ordinary pneumonia, but with this disease the life of the affected
portion of the lung is destroyed, the tissue dies, and a fibrous wall is formed
around it to shut it away from the living parts. The tissue, thus encysted,
gradually softens, becomes disintegrated, and breaks down into pus. The
recovery, therefore, is not complete; it is only apparent and partial.</p>

<p>To those accustomed to examining the lungs of cattle, other and extremely
important symptoms may be apparent during the course of the disease. By
applying the ear over the walls of the chest an area of a certain extent may be
found in which the natural breathing sound is diminished or entirely lost. This
represents the diseased portion of the lungs. In other cases a loud blowing
sound may be heard, quite different from any sound produced when the lung is in
a healthy condition. In some cases crepitation is heard near the border line of
the diseased area and friction sounds produced by the roughened pleura; these
can be appreciated, however, only by those whose ears have been trained to
distinguish between the different sounds which reach the ear when applied to
the chest wall. By percussion&mdash;that is, by pressing the fingers of the
left hand firmly against the wall of the chest and tapping upon the middle
finger with the ends of the fingers of the right hand&mdash;an area of dullness
may be discovered corresponding to the portion from which the respiratory
murmur has disappeared. This loss of respiration detected by auscul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>tation, and
the dullness brought out by percussion, are the most important evidences
of an inflamed or consolidated lung.</p>

<p>Seriously affected animals remain standing if they have sufficient strength,
but those which lie down always lie on the affected side.</p>

<p>The proportion of animals which become affected after being exposed varies
according to the virulence of the outbreak, the susceptibility of the animals,
and the length of time during which exposure is continued. Sometimes not more
than 15, 20, or 30 per cent will contract the disease when a large herd is
exposed; on the other hand, however, 80 or 90 per cent may be affected. The
proportion of cases in which the disease proves fatal also varies
greatly&mdash;it may not exceed 10 and it may reach 50 per cent. In general, it
may be said that about 40 per cent of the exposed animals will contract the
disease and about one-half of these cases will prove fatal.</p>

<p><em>Post-mortem appearances</em>.&mdash;Owing to the complexity of the structure of
the lung tissue, its ramifications of bronchial tubes and blood vessels, and
its abundant supply of lymphatics, the pathological changes in pleuropneumonia
are interpreted with great difficulty. Furthermore, there are certain kinds of
pneumonia which present some resemblances to pleuropneumonia and which may
therefore be confused with it in some of its phases.</p>

<p>If we kill an animal affected with acute pleuropneumonia and examine the
cavity of the chest and lungs, the following appearances will be noted:</p>

<p>The thorax may contain more or less serum, which may be clear or clouded.
There may be firm adhesions of different parts of the lungs to the chest wall,
the extent of which depends on the stage and severity of the disease. The
diseased lobes are unusually large and exceedingly firm to the touch. The
weight of a single large lobe may reach 40 pounds. Usually only one side is
affected, often but a single lobe, and this most commonly the large or
principal lobe. The pleura may be covered with one or more layers of a firm,
elastic, grayish membrane, which varies in thickness and which sometimes may be
pulled away entirely. Sometimes it is absent. The pleura, however, is opaque
and apparently very much thickened. This is owing to the diseased condition of
the connective tissue beneath the pleura, as will be explained later. When an
affected lobe is cut through at right angles to its long diameter, the cut
surface presents a variety of interesting changes. In the first place the
spaces between the small subdivisions of the lung (the lobules), which in the
healthy lung are barely visible, are distended with a yellowish-white, usually
quite firm, substance, which is coagulated fibrin. The cut surface thus appears
divided into small fields by yellowish-white bands of varying thickness running
in various directions through the lung tissue and beneath the pleura. (<a
href="#PLATE_XXXI">Pl. XXXI</a>.) These bands may appear <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>honeycombed and the
spaces filled with yellowish fluid (serum) or they may be uniformly solid. It
will also be noticed that the space immediately outside of and around the
artery, vein, and air tube is similarly broadened by fibrinous deposits. Some
authorities look upon these bands as constituting the so-called "marbling" of
pleuropneumonia.</p>

<p>In addition to these changes which have taken place in the connective tissue
between the lobules, the lung tissue itself may be markedly altered.
Certain areas of the cut surface may be very firm in texture and of a
brownish-red color. The cut surface is granular or roughened, not smooth to the
eye. Other areas equally firm may be more grayish yellow and still others may
be blackish. (<a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Pl. XXXII</a>.) Besides these areas which
represent solidified (hepatized) lung tissue there may be others which approach
the normal lung tissue in color, are soft, and float in water. From these a
milky, purulent fluid may often be expressed. These different shades are
represented in <a href="#PLATE_XXXI">Plate XXXI</a>, fig. 2, within a small compass. Some authorities are
inclined to consider these variations in color on the same cut surface as the
so-called marbling of pleuropneumonia. It matters not whether we regard the
bands between the lobules or the varying shades of the lobules themselves as
the marbling, provided either or both are peculiar to contagious
pleuropneumonia. If we examine the blood vessels appearing on such cut surface
they will usually be found plugged within the firmly hepatized regions. The
artery contains a dark, soft, removable clot, the vein a grayish-pink,
granular, fragile plug (thrombus), which adheres firmly to the wall of the
vein, and if this is slit open, indications of a diseased condition of the
inner coat will be readily detected. When large regions of the lung tissues are
hepatized, the main air tube and its branches are usually filled with grayish,
cylindrical branched masses of fibrin that are easily removed, as they do not
adhere to the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The views of pathologists differ as to the nature of the earliest changes in
pleuropneumonia, and it is not within the scope of this work to present
controverted or imperfectly developed theories. In the foregoing description we
have taken as a type the acute pleuropneumonia in its fully developed phase,
which can scarcely be mistaken for any other disease. We have seen that there
is an inflammatory condition of the connective tissue between the lobules,
resulting in the exudation of coagulable lymph. This inflammation is equally
marked around the blood vessels and air tubes. It leads to inflammatory changes
in the inner wall of the veins, and these cause the deposition of thrombi or
plugs in the vessels, which prevent the return of the blood. The blood pumped
into the lung tissue through the artery, but unable to get out by way of the
vein, leaves the mesh-work of capillaries around the air vesicles, enters the
latter, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]
</a></span>duces the firm, hepatized condition so characteristic of this
disease. If we bear in mind that the veins in different parts of the lung
tissue are plugged at different times, and that, therefore, the affected
regions are in different stages of disease, it will be easily understood how
the different shades of color from dark red to grayish or yellowish red are
produced.</p>

<p>The complete plugging of the veins may lead to the death of circumscribed
masses of lung tissue. A line of separation forms between the living and the
dead tissue and a thick cyst wall of fibrous tissue forms around the latter.
The dead tissue for a time preserves the appearance of lung tissue, then
undergoes disintegration and liquefaction. The softened mass is finally
absorbed, and the walls of the cyst, or capsule around it, gradually collapse
and form a cicatrix. This favorable termination takes place only when the dead
mass is not too large. It may, however, involve over half of one of the large
lobes. Under such circumstances recovery is improbable. A more favorable
termination is the abundant growth of fibrous tissue around and into the
hepatized masses. The formation of fibrous tissue may extend to the pleura, or
lung covering, and cause firm adhesion of the lungs to the chest wall
and to the pericardium, or heart case.</p>

<p>The same peculiar, inflammatory changes which take place between the lobules
of the lung and around the bronchi and vessels may invade the pleural cavity,
cause extensive membranous and spongy deposits on the pleura and firm deposits
around the heart and large arteries, the gullet, and windpipe.</p>

<p>These are the main features of the lung disease caused by contagious
pleuropneumonia. In the typical, acute cases there are a sufficient number of
peculiarities to enable us to make a positive diagnosis. There are, however,
many cases in which the disease is restricted to small areas, or to the
interlobular tissue, or in which the changes are still imperfectly developed,
or else so far advanced that doubts may arise as to the true nature of the
affection. In such cases all obtainable facts, including the history of the
case, the symptoms during life, and the pathological changes observed on
post-mortem examination must be taken into consideration. Only one who has made
a careful study of the disease is fitted to decide in such cases.</p>

<p>Other kinds of lung disease, because of certain features common to most lung
diseases of cattle, may be confounded with pleuropneumonia. The inflammation of
the connective tissue between the lobules is not infrequently observed in
so-called interstitial pneumonia and may lead to the formation of whitish bands
intersecting the lung tissues in various directions. On the cut surface these
bands may give rise to a decidedly marbled appearance. Again, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
traumatic pneumonia, caused, as its name implies, by the entrance of foreign
bodies into the lung tissue, generally from the paunch, the connective tissue
around the place of disease becomes inflamed and thickened, and the disease
itself may simulate pleuropneumonia in its retrogressive stages when it is
confined to a small portion of lung tissue. The filling up of the interlobular
spaces with fibrin and connective tissue of inflammatory origin is not thus
limited to pleuropneumonia, but may appear in a marked degree in other lung
diseases. It must not be inferred from this statement that these interlobular
changes are necessarily the same as those in pleuropneumonia, although to the
naked eye they may appear the same. We simply note their presence without
discussing their nature.</p>

<p>In general, the distinction between pleuropneumonia and bronchopneumonia is
not difficult to make. In the latter disease the pneumonia generally invades
certain lobes. The disease attacks the smaller lobes in their lowest portions
first and gradually extends upward, i. e., toward the root of the lung or the
back of the animal and backward into the large principal lobes. Again, both
lungs in advanced cases are often symmetrically affected. In contagious
pleuropneumonia the large principal lobe of one side is most frequently
affected, and a symmetrical disease of both lungs is very rare, if, in fact, it
has ever been observed. The lung tissue in bronchopneumonia is not enlarged,
but rather more contracted than the normal tissue around it. This is well
illustrated in <a href="#PLATE_XXX">Plate XXX</a>. Normal, air-containing lobules may be scattered among
and around the hepatized portion in an irregular manner. In pleuropneumonia the
diseased and healthy portions are either sharply divided off, one from the
other, or else they shade into each other by intermediate stages.</p>

<p>The hepatized lung tissue in bronchopneumonia when the cut surface is
examined is visually of a more or less dark flesh color with paler
grayish-yellow dots regularly interspersed, giving it a peculiar, mottled
appearance. In the more advanced stages it becomes more firm, and may contain
nodular and firmer masses disseminated through it. The air tubes usually
contain more or less soft, creamy, or cheesy pus or a turbid fluid quite
different from the loose, fibrinous casts of acute pleuropneumonia. The
interlobular tissue may or may not be affected. It sometimes contains loose,
fibrinous plugs, or it may be greatly distended with air, especially in the
still normal portions of the lung. The pleura is seldom seriously diseased. If
we contrast with these features the firm dark-red hepatizations, the plugging
of the veins, the extensive interlobular deposits, and the well-marked
pleuritis in pleuropneumonia, there is little chance for confusion between
well-developed cases of these two lung diseases.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten, however, that the lesions of the disease known
as contagious pleuropneumonia may be confined to the serous <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>membranes of the
thorax, or they may be confined to the parenchyma of the lungs; they may affect
a whole lobe, or only a small portion of it; they may or may not cause the
so-called marbled appearance. In the same way bronchopneumonia may vary as to
the parts of the lung affected, the extent of the lesions, the degree and kind
of pathological changes in the interlobular tissue, the color of the lung on
cross section and the amount of hepatization. In individual cases, therefore,
it is often necessary to take into account the history of the animal, the
course of the disease, and the communicability of the affection before a
diagnosis can be made between the two diseases.</p>

<p><em>Prevention and treatment</em>.&mdash;The prevention of pleuropneumonia, as of
other contagious diseases, consists in keeping animals so that they will not be
exposed to the contagion. As the disease arises only by contagion, there is no
possibility of an animal becoming affected with it unless it has been exposed.
If, therefore, pleuropneumonia exists in a locality the owner of healthy cattle
should make every effort to keep his animals from coming near affected ones or
which have been exposed. He should be equally particular not to allow persons
who have been on the infected premises to visit his own pastures, stables, or
cattle.</p>

<p>If pleuropneumonia breaks out in a herd, every animal in it should be
slaughtered, the stables thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and no other
cattle allowed on the premises until a period of 90 days has elapsed.</p>

<p>Medical treatment of affected animals is unavailing and should not be
attempted. No matter how valuable the diseased animals may have been before
they contracted the disease, they should at once be destroyed and the contagion
eradicated. This is the best policy for the individual as well as for the
community.</p>

<p>The eradication of this disease by local or National Governments can be
successful only when the same principles are adopted and carried out as here
recommended for individual stables. It is then a difficult undertaking, simply
because the contagion is generally widely disseminated before any measures are
adopted, and because a great majority of cattle owners will never report the
existence of the disease. Regulations must therefore be enforced which will
insure the prompt discovery of every herd in which the disease appears, as well
as the destruction of all diseased and exposed animals and the thorough
disinfection of the premises.</p>

<p>To discover pleuropneumonia sufficiently early for this purpose, the
district supposed to be infected should be clearly defined and inspectors
should be constantly employed to inspect every herd in it at least once in two
weeks, or, better, once a week. No bovine animal should be allowed to go out of
the defined district alive, and all which enter it should be carefully
inspected to insure their freedom <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378"
id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>from disease. As an assistance to the
discovery of diseased herds, every animal which, from any cause, dies in the
infected district and every animal which is slaughtered, even if apparently in
good health, should be the subject of a careful post-mortem examination. Many
affected herds will be found in this way.</p>

<p>In addition to these measures it is also necessary to guard against the
removal of animals from one stable to another and the mixing of herds upon
common pastures or in the public highways. The object must be to isolate every
individual's cattle as completely as possible, or otherwise a single affected
animal may infect a dozen or more herds. To prevent surreptitious sale or
trading of cattle, each animal must in some way be numbered and recorded in the
books kept by the official in charge of the district. In the work of the United
States Department of Agriculture a numbered metal tag was fastened to each
animal's ear and index books were so arranged that with a number given the
owner could be at once ascertained, or from the owner's name the cattle for
which he was responsible could be at once learned. In this way, if an animal
was missing from a stable, the fact became apparent at once, or if one too many
was found in a stable the number in its ear would indicate where it came
from.</p>

<p>When pleuropneumonia is discovered by these means, the entire herd should be
slaughtered as soon as the formalities of appraisement can be arranged. In
country districts the carcasses should be buried, as it is generally
impracticable to dispose of them in any other way. In city districts the
animals may be taken to a slaughterhouse, with such precautions as are possible
to prevent dissemination of the contagion. The animals should be slaughtered
under the supervision of an inspector. The healthy carcasses may be utilized
for food, but the blood, entrails, and all diseased carcasses should be heated
to a temperature equal to that of boiling water or above, and then used for the
manufacture of fertilizers.</p>

<p>The disinfection of premises should be thorough and should be carried out by
a trained corps of men employed for the purpose. The floors of stables should
be removed, the accumulations removed from beneath them, the contents of
haylofts should be destroyed, and the woodwork and soil beneath the stables
should be thoroughly drenched with a solution of bichlorid of mercury, 1 part
to 2,000 of water. After the flooring is replaced the woodwork should be coated
with limewash, containing one-fourth pound of chlorid of lime to the gallon of
mixture.</p>

<p>Usually in these cases the owners are dependent upon their herd of cows for
a living, and consequently it is difficult or impossible to hold the stables
vacant for any considerable period. In a majority of instances cattle may be
admitted at once to stables so disinfected, without the reappearance of the
disease. Occasionally, however, it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379"
id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>will reappear without apparent cause. For
this reason the inspection and other measures must be maintained in the
infected district for six months or a year after the last case of disease has
been disposed of.</p>

<p>Many people have objected to the slaughter of diseased and exposed animals
as an unscientific and expensive method of eradicating the disease. To these it
may be answered that it is the only method which has ever proved successful,
and that in the end it is much more economical than temporizing measures.</p>

<p>Inoculation has been adopted in many countries, and has undoubtedly lessened
the death rate, but where this practice is allowed the disease is kept up and
spreads. For this reason it should be prohibited wherever there is a
possibility and disposition to eradicate the contagion.</p>

<h4><a name="RINDERPEST" id="RINDERPEST"></a>RINDERPEST.</h4>

<p>Rinderpest, also known as cattle plague, is an acute, infectious disease of
cattle, in which the digestive organs are mainly involved. Though unknown in
this country, the importance of having near at hand a few definite facts
concerning this disease, should it ever reach our shores, will be at once
appreciated. A knowledge of such facts may aid in an early recognition of the
disease. It must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that a superficial
knowledge of diseases, such as the layman may gain through reading, not
infrequently leads to confounding comparatively harmless, noninfectious
maladies with such as are truly dangerous (foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest,
etc), and causes temporary panics among stock owners.</p>

<p>According to some authorities, rinderpest has its home in the territory
around the Black Sea and the Volga River in Russia; according to others, in
Central Asia. Thence it has been conveyed at various times by cattle to nearly
every country of Europe and Asia, where it has proved to be a veritable bovine
scourge. It probably visited Europe as early as the beginning of the Christian
era, and since then the migrations of the people from the Far East have from
time to time introduced the disease. Especially during the eighteenth century
it was more or less prevalent in Europe, owing to the frequent wars, during
which herds of cattle were brought from eastern Europe and Asia to supply the
demands of the armies. It prevailed in Europe during the Franco-Prussian War.
At present it exists in eastern Europe and in portions of Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>The virus is conveyed from one country to another chiefly by means of
infected cattle, although infected hides, wool, and feed may play an important
part in its dissemination. The railroad facilities of the present, which
furnish the means of such rapid communication, are particularly liable to aid
in the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the past rinderpest has been supposed to be identical with various human
diseases, among them smallpox and typhoid fever. These suppositions are
unfounded, and the view of authorities to-day is that it is a disease of a
peculiar kind, not identical with any other known infectious disease.</p>

<p><em>The contagion of rinderpest</em>.&mdash;The cause of rinderpest must be looked
for among microorganisms&mdash;most likely bacteria. The investigations made
thus far for this causal factor have been fruitless. However, certain recent
experiments would indicate that the unseen microbe is of such dimensions that
it is withheld by the dense bacterial filters, but passes through the more
porous ones. Formerly it was supposed by various authorities that rinderpest
virus appeared spontaneously under the influence of deteriorated feed and long
and exhausting drives; also during unusual meteorological conditions. This
view, however, is no longer maintained. It is probable that in its home in Asia
the disease is perpetuated by continual infection of fresh animals, and some
authorities go even so far as to believe that the disease would be entirely
stamped out, even in its native haunts, by a destruction of all sick and
infected herds. However this may be, the success of such an undertaking would
largely depend on the nature of the cause. If a strictly parasitic organism,
like the contagion of pleuropneumonia, it might be completely extirpated in
this way. If, however, the germs or bacteria may live and multiply outside of
the bovine body, in the soil, water, or in some other animal, extirpation would
be impossible.</p>

<p>The virus may be transmitted in a variety of ways, both direct and indirect,
from sick to healthy animals. It is said to be present in the various excreta,
such as the discharges from the nose, and the saliva, the urine, and the
manure, of the diseased. For months it retains its vitality in a moist state
outside the body, and the disease is reported to have developed after feeding
hay a year after it had lain in an infected stable; hence manure and the fodder
and bedding soiled with discharges may convey it. Persons may carry the virus
on their shoes, clothing, or implements. Even small animals, such as cats and
rats, which frequent barns and stables, have been looked upon as carriers of
the virus.</p>

<p>Cattle are very susceptible to the disease, and in its virulent type all
those exposed are said to become infected. Buffaloes, sheep, and goats are
likewise susceptible, but in a less degree.</p>

<p>It is also claimed that animals after having passed through one attack
successfully resist future attacks. Inoculation with virus is said to produce
immunity, but in many cases the process of inoculation itself is followed by
death.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of rinderpest are not very characteristic, and
hence the diagnosis of a suspected case in the beginning of <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>an invasion is
attended with difficulties. Certain appearances which are characteristic of one
epizootic may be absent in another. Different observers are not quite agreed as
to the most constant and important.</p>

<p>The period of incubation, i. e., the time between the exposure to infection
and the earliest outward symptoms, varies from three to nine days. The first
sign is a very high fever, which may reach 107Â° F. The heat of the skin varies
in different parts of the body, and may be felt at the base of the ears and
horns. Repeated chills are frequently observed. The pulse reaches 50 to 60
beats a minute, and in very severe attacks may rise to 90 or 100.</p>

<p>The animal manifests great debility. The head droops and rests on some
object of support. One or both ears may droop. The coat is staring and the
muzzle dry. The secretion of milk diminishes very rapidly. Within twelve to
twenty hours the usual quantity may have become reduced one-half or two-thirds.
The back is arched, and the four limbs are brought together under the body.</p>

<p>As the disease progresses, symptoms with reference to the digestive and
respiratory organs become prominent. The mucous membrane of the mouth and the
nose, as well as that of the rectum and vagina, becomes reddened, either in
patches or diffusely, and assumes a scarlet hue. The discharges, at first firm,
become softer, and soon diarrhea sets in. This is said to be one of the most
constant symptoms. The rectum may become everted and paralyzed, and the bowels
move spontaneously. The discharges become fetid, viscid, and streaked with
blood. Coughing is a common symptom, and by some is considered characteristic.
It is associated with discharges from the nose and vagina and dribbling of
saliva from the mouth. The eyes also are affected. There is an increased
formation of a viscid secretion which flows down the face.</p>

<p>Another series of changes prominent in some epizootics and mild or absent in
others are the ulcers, or so-called "erosions," in the mouth. These begin as
red patches and streaks. The mucous membrane in such localities is converted
into a grayish-white slough, which, when shed, leaves a small erosion, or
ulcer. At the same time similar changes may go on in the skin of the thighs,
the udder, or the scrotum, or about the vagina, which lead to small sloughs.</p>

<p>In severe cases, which are the most common in the susceptible cattle of
western Europe, death ensues four to seven days after the first appearance of
the disease, and is preceded by great emaciation and debility, fetid,
purulent discharges from the nose and mouth, and the relaxed rectum and
vagina.</p>

<p>After death, if the animal is opened and the organs carefully examined, the
chief changes are found in the digestive organs. The lining membrane of the
mouth and pharynx is covered with mucus, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382"
id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>is reddened in spots, and shows
superficial, yellowish-gray, cheesy patches, which represent dead tissue, and
when removed expose ulcerated depressions. The same reddening in spots and the
yellowish-gray, cheesy deposits or patches are found in the fourth stomach, the
small intestines, and more rarely in the cecum, while the third stomach, or
manyplies, is more or less impacted with dry, hard feed. Similar changes may be
found on the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, larynx, trachea, the uterus,
vagina, and rectum. The lungs may be injected, edematous, or pneumonic. The
heart muscle is pale and flabby, and frequently hemorrhages are observed in its
internal membrane. The liver may be pale or injected with blood, and at times
shows hemorrhages beneath its capsule. The bile is thin and watery in
consistence. The kidneys may be inflamed or contain small hemorrhages within
their substance or under the capsule. The lymphatic glands may be swollen and
injected or even hemorrhagic.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;On account of the danger of spreading the infection,
neither medicinal treatment nor inoculation is permitted in European countries,
with the exception of Russia, where the disease is more generally diffused. The
most effective method of exterminating rinderpest in those districts in which
the disease is not indigenous has been found to be the slaughter of all
affected and exposed animals. Where the disease is general, successful efforts
adopted for its control have followed the immunization by inoculation of the
exposed animals and a strict application of appropriate sanitary measures. This
protective inoculation has been practiced with very gratifying results in
Russia, South Africa, and in the Philippine Islands. An active immunity is thus
induced in susceptible animals which lasts until the danger from exposure to
the disease is over. This immunity may be attained (1) by the inoculation of
pure bile from an animal which recently died of rinderpest, (2) by the
inoculation of glycerinated bile, followed by pure bile or virulent blood, or
(3) by the simultaneous inoculation of strong standardized serum and virulent
blood.</p>

<p>The latter method has been adopted by the United States Government in its
endeavor to exterminate the disease in the Philippines, and to protect the
cattle and carabaos against rinderpest after their importation into those
islands. Owing to the existence of this and other infectious diseases in the
Philippine Islands, an order has been issued by the Department of Agriculture
prohibiting the landing of any live stock or animals of any kind from the
Philippines at any of the ports of the United States or the dependencies
thereof. This prohibition removes the greatest source of danger to which the
United States is exposed as the result of its intercourse with the islands. The
introduction of rinderpest from those countries from which we import animals is
rendered extremely improbable, especially in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383"
id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>live animals, owing to its short period of
incubation and to the 90-day quarantine for cattle (counting from date of shipment)
and 15-day (counting from date of landing) quarantine for sheep and other
ruminants and swine which are at present enforced in the United States at all
ports of entry.</p>

<h4>FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Pl. XXXIII</a>.]</h5>

<p>Foot-and-mouth disease, also known as aphthous fever, epizootic aphtha, and
eczema contagiosa, is an acute, highly communicable disease chiefly confined to
cloven-footed animals and characterized by an eruption of vesicles or blisters
on the mucous membrane of the mouth and on the skin between the toes and above
the hoofs. The vesicles rupture, forming erosions and ulcerations; there are
also salivation, tenderness of the affected parts, loss of appetite, lameness,
emaciation, and diminution in the quantity of milk secreted.</p>

<p>The tremendous ravages of the disease are seen in the number and variety of
the species attacked. While it may be regarded as essentially a disease of
cattle, hogs would seem to be as easy a prey. Almost in the same grade of
receptivity are sheep and goats. Next in order of susceptibility come the
buffalo, American bison, camel, chamois, llama, giraffe, and antelope. Horses,
dogs, cats, and even poultry may occasionally become infected with the disease,
the last three being particularly dangerous as carriers of the contagion. Man
himself is not immune, and the frequency of his infection by coming in contact
with diseased animals is established by numerous observations.</p>

<p>As with other communicable diseases, the source and origin of foot-and-mouth
disease have given rise to much speculation. The disease had been known in
Europe for centuries, but it was not until comparatively recent years that the
erroneous conceptions of its spontaneous origin as a result of climatic and
meteorological conditions, exhausting journeys, etc., were abandoned. It is now
conceded that foot-and-mouth disease is propagated by a specific virus and that
every outbreak starts from some preexisting outbreak.</p>

<p>So far investigators have been unable to identify or isolate the specific
organism causing the disease, although numerous attempts have been made to
cultivate and stain it by laboratory methods. Experiments have shown that the
virus will pass through standard germ-proof filters, thus indicating its minute
size and the reason it has not been detected by the staining methods. The
contagion may be found in the serum of the vesicles on the mouth, feet, and
udder; in the saliva, milk, and various secretions and excretions; also in the
blood during the rise of temperature.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
</p>

<p>A wide distribution of the virus and a rapid infection of a herd is the
result. Animals may be infected directly, as by licking, and in calves by
sucking, or indirectly by such things as infected manure, hay, utensils,
drinking troughs, railway cars, animal markets, barnyards, and pastures. Human
beings may carry the virus on their shoes and clothing and transmit it on their
hands when milking, since the udder is occasionally the seat of the eruption.
It may also be carried by dogs, cats, rats, chickens, pigeons, etc. Milk in a
raw state may also transmit the disease to animals fed with it.</p>

<p>The observations made by some veterinarians would lead us to suppose that
the virus is quite readily destroyed. It is claimed that stables thoroughly
cleaned become safe after drying for a short time; hence, litter of all kinds,
such as manure or soiled hay and straw, may remain infective for a longer time
because they do not dry out. Other authorities maintain that the virus is quite
tenacious and may live in stables even so long as a year. They also state that
animals which have passed through the disease may be a source of infection for
several months after recovery.</p>

<p>Unlike most other infectious diseases, foot-and-mouth disease may repeatedly
attack the same animals. The immunity conferred by an attack is of limited
duration.</p>

<p>The period of incubation (that is, the time between the exposure of an
animal to infection and the development of the disease) is variable, usually
from three to six days. The disease may appear in 24 hours, or, in exceptional
cases, not for 18 days or even longer.</p>

<p><em>Losses</em>.&mdash;The highly contagious character of foot-and-mouth disease and
its rapid spread to practically all exposed susceptible animals lead to heavy
losses. Since the mortality is comparatively low, ranging from only 3 per cent
or less in mild forms to 30 or 40 per cent in malignant cases, the havoc caused
by the pestilence is sometimes underestimated. But there are other sources of
loss which are much more important than the actual mortality. The fever and the
difficulty of eating cause a rapid and extreme loss in flesh and a lessening or
cessation of the milk secretion. The udders often become inflamed and ruined by
the formation of abscesses, and cows affected in this way are sometimes
rendered permanently valueless for milk production. The inflammation of the
feet may cause the horn to drop from the toes, producing great lameness and
lasting injury. Abortion is frequent, and typical lesions have been observed in
the newly born at birth. Altogether these losses may amount to 20 or 30 per
cent of the value of the affected animals.</p>

<p>In addition there are indirect losses of a commercial nature. Dairy farmers
are put out of business for a time. Necessary quarantine restrictions greatly
interfere with the movement of live stock and such commodities as hay, straw,
hides, and farm produce. The business of the stockyards and slaughtering centers is
greatly interfered with. Sometimes it is necessary to close stockyards for
disinfection. The whole business of marketing, transporting, feeding, and
slaughtering is interrupted and deranged. Losses of this character may reach
enormous proportions.</p>

</p>

<p><em>The disease in other countries</em>.&mdash;Foot-and-mouth disease has prevailed
in Europe for a great many years and has occasioned tremendous economic losses
there.</p>

<p>In Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Russia the plague has existed so
long and has gained such a foothold that it is economically impossible to fight
it with the American methods of slaughter and disinfection, for to do so would
kill a large percentage of the live stock of those countries. In consequence,
little or no progress toward eradication has been made by the authorities,
though the severity of the disease in France appears to have abated somewhat in
recent months.</p>

<p>The outbreak which appeared in Germany in 1888 increased steadily until
1892, when it diminished gradually for a few years, but the disease again
reached great proportions in 1899. Thereafter it continued to exist to a
greater or less extent until in 1911 it attained a virulence unequaled before.
In that year 3,366,369 cattle, 1,602,927 sheep, 2,555,371 hogs, and 53,674
goats were affected. At that time the total number of cattle, sheep, swine, and
goats in Germany was only 51,319,000, while there were in the United States
172,572,000, or between three and four times as many. It can readily be
imagined, therefore, what it would mean to the United States if the disease
were to gain the foothold here that it had in Germany, where, as these figures
show, approximately one out of seven of the animals susceptible to the disease
was affected.</p>

<p>The German Government, of course, has not left the disease to itself. It
attempted to control some outbreaks by the method of slaughter, but the
pestilence had gained too much headway and was too firmly established in too
many portions of the country for this method to succeed, and the slaughter of
the infected herds had to be abandoned. It now appears that there is no hope of
getting rid of it until the virus has worn itself out. As soon as the animals'
period of acquired immunity is over and favorable conditions present
themselves, the contagion breaks out with renewed virulence. It has been
impossible to control it by means of quarantines. One scientist has asserted
that unless all the infected farms were absolutely isolated and the movement,
not only of live stock but of persons, absolutely prohibited, the disease could
not be stamped out. Such a quarantine is, of course, utterly impossible to
enforce. In portions of Germany the farmers, realizing that the disease is
inevitable, make haste to be done with it by exposing their stock deliber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>ately
to mild cases in the hope that this will result in an immediate, mild attack
and immunity for several years thereafter. Such immunity, however, is very
uncertain.</p>

<p>Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, on account of their
comparatively isolated positions, have been more successful in keeping out the
disease. The outbreaks in those countries have been more sporadic, and by
resorting to immediate slaughter the authorities have been able to stamp them
out. Great Britain has applied both quarantine and slaughter for many years,
and in an outbreak near Dublin in 1912 measures were adopted which were even
more stringent than any that have been used in the United States. A British
official (Cope) asserted in 1899 that after his country's experience with this
disease it was "more dreaded by the farmers and stock raisers of Great Britain
than cattle plague or pleuropneumonia, and they are now willing and ready to
put up with any restrictions, of however drastic a character, considered
necessary by the central department to stamp it out." The British authorities
have succeeded in suppressing each outbreak, but reinfection often occurs from
the neighboring continent. At the present time (April, 1922) Great Britain is
having a siege of the disease, but is applying vigorous measures for its
suppression.</p>

<p>In November, 1906, the disease reached Belgium from France, where it was
quite prevalent, and by the end of the year every Province in Belgium was
affected, and the Netherlands as well. Efforts to eradicate it from Belgium
were unavailing. The Netherlands apparently succeeded in stamping it out for
about six months, but it reappeared there.</p>

<p>The disease is also more or less prevalent in Central Europe, Spain, and in
the Balkan countries.</p>

<p>Australia and New Zealand have remained free from it.</p>

<p>We have less accurate information regarding Asia and Africa, but the disease
is known to prevail in Japan and China and in the Philippine Islands, and it is
doubtful whether any considerable part of the Orient is free from it.</p>

<p>In South America it is reported as common in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay,
and it probably exists in other countries.</p>

<p>Canada and Mexico are fortunately free from the disease.</p>

<p><em>Outbreaks in the United States</em>.&mdash;Foot-and-mouth disease has appeared in
the United States on six different occasions&mdash;1870, 1880, 1884, 1902,
1908, and 1914.</p>

<p>An extensive outbreak in 1870 was introduced by way of Canada, where the
infection was brought by an importation of cattle from Scotland. It spread into
the New England States and New York and appears to have been arrested within a
few months. Its failure to spread more extensively and its early disappearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
have been ascribed to favorable conditions, such as the movement of live stock
from west to east, the limited trading at that period as compared with the
present time, the restriction of traffic by winter weather, and the
infrequency of travel which obtained at that time among people.</p>

<p>About 1880 two or three lots of animals affected by this disease were
brought to the United States, but there was no extension from the animals
originally affected.</p>

<p>In 1884, at Portland, Me., there was a small outbreak caused by imported
cattle, and the disease spread to a few herds outside the quarantine station.
Owing to the small number of animals affected and the limited area of territory
covered by the disease, it was easily controlled by the ordinary measures of
quarantine and disinfection.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in all these early outbreaks the contagion was
introduced with imported animals. Since the development of a stringent system
of inspection and quarantine of imported live stock, no instance of that kind
has occurred. On subsequent occasions the infection has evidently been brought
in with contaminated products or materials and not by means of live animals.</p>

<p>In November, 1902, the disease was discovered in Massachusetts and Rhode
Island. The earliest cases were traced to Chelsea, Mass., near the docks, and
it was suspected for a time that the infection was brought in with foreign
shipping, by some such means as hay, straw, halters, ropes, hides, hair, wool,
etc. Later developments, however, and especially investigations into the cause
of the 1908 outbreak, led to the belief that a more probable source of the
infection was cowpox vaccine virus imported from a country (probably Japan)
where foot-and-mouth disease existed, the vaccine virus being contaminated with
the virus of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

<p>A Federal quarantine was declared by the Secretary of Agriculture on
November 27, 1902, as soon as the nature of the disease was established, and
steps for eradication were at once taken by the Bureau of Animal Industry of
the United States Department of Agriculture in cooperation with authorities of
the affected States. The methods followed consisted of inspection to trace and
detect the disease, quarantine of infected premises and territory, slaughter
and burial or burning of diseased and exposed animals, and disinfection of
premises.</p>

<p>This outbreak involved Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode
Island, and was eradicated in about six months. Two hundred and forty-four
herds, including 4,712 cattle, were found infected. Of these, 205 herds with
3,872 cattle, as well as 360 hogs and 220 sheep and goats, were slaughtered.
The cattle infected but not slaughtered were those that either died or
completely recovered before slaughtering could be carried out. The animals
slaughtered were valued at $184,155.10, and the Federal Government reimbursed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
owners to the extent of 70 per cent, or $128,908.57. It is understood that the
States paid the remainder. The total cost to the Department of Agriculture of
stamping out the disease was about $300,000.</p>

<p>The next appearance of the foot-and-mouth disease was early in November,
1908, when it was observed in cattle near Danville, Pa. A Federal quarantine
was issued November 12. The infection was traced back to the stockyards at East
Buffalo, N. Y., and to Detroit, Mich. The disease appeared in the States of
Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. A careful and thorough
investigation made by Mohler of the Bureau of Animal Industry and Rosenau of
the Public Health Service demonstrated that the outbreak started from calves
used to propagate vaccine virus at an establishment near Detroit, and that the
source of the infection was contaminated Japanese vaccine virus.</p>

<p>Vigorous measures of eradication similar to those employed in 1902-3 were at
once put into effect and the disease was stamped out in about five months at an
expense of about $300,000 to the Department of Agriculture, and of about
$113,000 to the States. The inspectors made 108,683 visits to farms,
stockyards, etc., and inspected more than 1,500,000 animals (including
reinspections). One hundred and fifty-seven premises were found infected, and
3,636 animals (2,025 cattle, 1,329 hogs, and 282 sheep and goats), valued at
$90,033.18, were slaughtered. Owners were reimbursed for the value of their
animals and property destroyed, one-third being paid by the States and
two-thirds by the Federal Government.</p>

<p>The latest invasion was discovered in the vicinity of Niles, Mich., in
October, 1914, after it had evidently been under way since August of the same
year. This is the most serious and extensive outbreak ever known in this
country. The disease extended to 22 States and the District of Columbia, at
places ranging from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts. The work of eradication
was not completed for more than a year. The affected States were Connecticut,
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
Illinois had the largest infected area and the largest number of animals
affected. The Union Stock Yards at Chicago became infected and were a source of
dissemination of the contagion north, east, south, and west. These and other
yards found infected were closed temporarily and disinfected.</p>

<p>The first Federal quarantine was issued October 19, 1914. A campaign to
check the spread of the disease and to stamp it out was immediately begun by
the United States Department of Agriculture in cooperation with the State
authorities. Quarantines against the movement of animals and certain materials
from the infected areas <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">
[Pg 389]</a></span>were declared, shipments were traced, rumors
investigated, and thorough inspections made in an effort to discover all
infected stock. As measures of eradication, diseased herds were slaughtered and
buried and the premises disinfected. The owners of live stock and other
property destroyed on account of the disease were reimbursed to the extent of
the appraised value, half of which is paid by the Federal Government and half
by the State. There were slaughtered 172,720 animals (76,575 cattle, 86,492
swine, 9,511 sheep, 133 goats, and 9 deer), in 3,482 herds. The total appraised
value of these animals was more than $5,800,000. The expense to the
Federal Government of eradicating this outbreak was about $4,540,000.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;In three to six days, or even longer, after the exposure of
the animal to the infection the disease makes its appearance. It is usually
first indicated by the animal suffering from a chill, quickly followed by an
invasion of fever, which may cause the temperature to rise as high as 106Â° F.
These symptoms are not always present, or may be in so slight a form as to
escape notice. Following this in one or two days it will be noticed that small
vesicles or blisters about the size of hempseeds or peas are making their
appearance upon the mucous membranes of the mouth at the border and upper
surface of the tongue near the tip, the inside of the cheeks, on the gums and
the inner surface of the lips, or on the margin of the dental pad. These little
blisters contain a yellowish, watery fluid and gradually become more extensive
as the disease advances. Soon after the eruptions have appeared in the
mouth of the animal considerable swelling, redness, and tenderness will be
noticed about the feet, at the coronet, and between the digits of each foot. A
day or two later eruptions similar to those within the mouth make their
appearance upon these swollen regions of the foot, and at this stage it is
usual to find that like lesions have made their appearance upon the perineum of
the victim. In the case of milk cows the udder, and more particularly the
teats, show the same vesicular eruption, but the latter as the result of
milking soon become covered with reddened spots deprived of the superficial
layer of skin and may develop deep, obstinate fissures.</p>

<p>As soon as the disease has become well established the patient evinces pain
when attempting to eat; in fact, the appetite is often so seriously affected
that all feed is refused, and the animal uneasily opens and shuts its mouth
with a characteristic smacking sound, while strings of cohesive, ropy saliva hang
suspended from the lips. With the advance of the disease the vesicles widen
and extend until they may reach a diameter ranging from that of a dime to that
of a silver dollar. These rupture soon after their appearance, sometimes on the
first day, more rarely on the second or third day. After they have ruptured,
the grayish-white membrane forming the blister <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390"
id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>may remain attached for a day or more, or
disappear speedily and leave deeply reddened, sensitive spots or erosions, both
within the mouth and upon the coronet and between the claws of the feet.
Similar erosions, which quickly form scabs, as a rule, may be noticed in
cases in which the teats of milk cows have become affected, and instances
are reported in which sloughing of the tegument immediately around the lesions
upon the udder has occurred. Owing to the tough, fibrous nature of the bovine
skin, it is exceedingly rare for sloughing to occur upon any part of the
body other than those mentioned.</p>

<p>The attack upon the feet of an animal is frequently manifested in all four
feet at once, but one or more of the feet may entirely escape and remain
unaffected throughout the course of the disease. The ulceration of the
interdigital tissue may extend to the ligaments of the fetlock or produce
disease of the joint or bone. As the feet become sensitive and sore the animal
persistently lies down, and it has been found that bedsores develop with
amazing rapidity in all such cases and wholly baffle all attempts at treatment
until after the patient has regained its feet.</p>

<p>The disease may attack some of the internal organs before it appears upon
any of the external tissues. These cases are very liable to prove quickly
fatal. The animal dies from paralysis of the heart, due to the formation of
poisonous principles within the system; it may suffocate by reason of the
action of these same poisons upon the tissues of the lungs, or it may choke to
death as a result of paralysis of the throat.</p>

<p>In cases of serious affection of the udder the erosions will often be found
within the passages of the teats, resulting in a "caked" udder, and the same
toxic poisoning which is the cause of death in the apoplectiform types just
mentioned may arise from this source. In any event the milk from such cases is
dangerous for use, causing fatal diarrhea in sucking calves or young pigs and
serious illness in human consumers. The milk obtained from cows suffering with
foot-and-mouth disease is not readily converted into either butter or cheese,
but remains thick, slimy, and inert in spite of churning and attempts at
curdling. Pregnant animals may abort. In pigs, sheep, and goats the lesions in
the foot are most common, but both forms may be observed or only the mouth
lesions.</p>

<p>When the disease has become fully established it will be found that the
duration of the attack will vary greatly with different animals. From 10 to 20
days are usually required for the recovery of the normal appetite and spirits
in mild outbreaks, while the return to a full flow of milk, in the case of milk
cows, seldom occurs before the arrival of the following season.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the malignant type of the disease it requires from three months to a year
for an animal to recover. The mortality, as already stated, is usually low. The
disease is more fatal in young animals that have been fed on infected milk, and
produces death in from 60 to 80 per cent of these cases as a result of
gastroenteritis. In the 1914 outbreak numerous new centers of infection started
among hogs and calves which were fed on unpasteurized, infected milk from
creameries.</p>

<p><em>Diagnosis</em>.&mdash;The recognition of this affection should not, as a rule, be
difficult, especially when the disease is known to be in the vicinity; in fact,
the group of symptoms form a clinical picture too decided to be doubted. The
combination of high fever, vesicular inflammation of the mouth, and hot,
painful, swollen condition of the feet, followed 24 to 48 hours later by the
appearance of numerous blisters varying in size from that of a pea to that of a
walnut on the udder and feet and in the mouth should prevent any serious or
long-continued error in the diagnosis; however, in the inoculation of calves we
have a certain and final test. In 24 to 96 hours after inoculation the calves
present the characteristic blisters. Such inoculation should be practiced,
however, only by officials properly authorized to deal with contagious
diseases.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;The lesions of no other disease of cattle
closely simulate the vesicular eruption of foot-and-mouth disease on the lining
membrane of the mouth. When the blisters have ruptured, however, and the
resulting lesions have become contaminated by numerous secondary forms of
microorganisms, the correct recognition of the disease may be involved in
considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>Cowpox or horsepox may be accidentally transmitted by inoculation. But the
eruption of the "pox" goes on to the development of a pustule, while in
foot-and-mouth disease the eruption is never more than a vesicle, even though
the contained fluid may become turbid. The inoculation test in the case of
cowpox does not respond with fever and eruption for at least 10 days, and often
longer.</p>

<p>Necrotic stomatitis (sore mouth due to a germ) may be distinguished from
foot-and-mouth disease by the fact that in the latter there is a rapid
infection of the entire herd, including the adult cattle, as well as the
infection of hogs and sheep. The characteristic lesion of foot-and-mouth
disease is the appearance of blisters containing a serous fluid upon the mucous
membrane of the mouth and upon the udder, teats, and feet of the affected
animals. In necrotic stomatitis blisters are never formed, destruction of the
tissues occurring from the beginning and being followed by the formation of
yellowish, cheesy patches, principally found involving the lining membrane of
the mouth, especially the tongue and cheeks.</p>

<p>In mycotic stomatitis (sore mouth due to a fungus or mold), portions of the
lining membrane become inflamed and in a few days it <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> changes to a croupous
membrane which peels off, leaving a raw surface, while the thin skin between
the toes may also be inflamed. The previous history of the case; the failure of
the blisters, if any appear, to spread extensively; the absence of vesicular
eruptions on other portions of the body, notably the udder and teats, and,
characteristically, the hoof, together with the absence of rapid spread to
practically all cattle in the herd and the complete negative character of
inoculation of calves, distinguish between the local disease named and
foot-and-mouth disease. Mycotic stomatitis occurs in only from 10 to 50 per
cent of the animals in a herd, usually in the late summer or early fall after a
dry spell, and it does not run a regular course.</p>

<p>The lesion, resulting from ergotism may be distinguished from those of
foot-and-mouth disease by the lack of eruptions in the mouth and by the
location of the disease at the tips of the ears, end of the tail, or upon the
lower part of the legs, usually below the knees or hocks. The lesion of
ergotism does not take the form of pustules or blisters, but manifests itself
first as a swelling about the ankle, which later may slough and circumscribe
the limb, forming a deep crack, extending entirely around the limb and forming
a distinct line of demarcation between the healthy skin above and the diseased
below. The absence of ulcerous sores on the coronet and between the claws,
together with the healthy condition of the membranes of the mouth and the
knowledge that the lesion upon the limb in question extends uninterruptedly
around it, should point conclusively to a diagnosis of ergotism and to the
exclusion of all fears of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

<p>In foul foot or ground itch of cattle, the inflammation of the skin and toes
is general and not in certain spots, as in foot-and-mouth disease. The mouth
remains unaffected, and the presence of the disease may be traced to filth and
poor drainage.</p>

<p>The severer forms of the disease might be confounded with certain general
diseases. If gastrointestinal symptoms predominate, acute gastric catarrh or
inflammation of the intestines might be thought of. Involvement of the lungs
may lead to a diagnosis of acute congestion of the lungs or pneumonia. The
distinction is apparent in these diseases by the lack of vesicular eruption on
the mucous membrane or skin, and also by lack of evidences of infection in the
herd or neighboring animals.</p>

<p><em>Prevention and eradication</em>.&mdash;The measures to be adopted to prevent the
spread of the affection must take into consideration the highly infectious
nature of the disease, its ease of dissemination, and the liability of the
virus to live for long periods outside the body of an animal. Great care should
therefore be observed in keeping healthy animals unexposed to the contagion.
When an outbreak occurs in a community the owner should make every effort to
keep other animals from coming in contact with his diseased cattle. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
especially applies to dogs, cats, goats, and poultry, which usually have access
to the stables and barnyards and in this way furnish excellent means for
disseminating the infectious principle. He should be equally particular in
prohibiting any person from coming onto his premises, especially an attendant
or owner or other person in any way connected with cattle. Such a herd may be
placed under quarantine, with an inspector appointed to keep the premises under
constant surveillance.</p>

<p>This method of quarantine alone, while very satisfactory in many instances,
is rather tardy in obtaining the desired result. The experience of European
Governments already mentioned shows that eradication by this method alone, when
the disease has obtained a foothold, is practically impossible. For this
reason, when the disease breaks out in a country like the United States, where
the contagion is likely to spread rapidly by means of infected cars, manure,
hay, and other feed, and where the results of its obtaining a firm foothold
would be so disastrous, it seems that this method of temporizing is rather
tedious, and more radical steps are required in order to suppress and eradicate
completely the infection in the quickest and most thorough manner possible.</p>

<p>It would therefore appear better, after judicious appraisement, to
concentrate the expense incident to the extermination of foot-and-mouth disease
by purchasing and slaughtering all affected and exposed cattle. The carcasses
of these animals should be totally destroyed, preferably by cremation, or
otherwise by burying them in a hole 6 feet deep and covering them with
air-slaked lime. The infected stable should be disinfected by thoroughly
cleaning it, scrubbing the floor with hot water, brushing down all loose dust
from the walls, and tearing off all woodwork which is partly decayed. Then the
whole interior of the stable should be disinfected with one of the following
substances:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 5 per cent solution of pure carbolic acid.</li>
<li>Chlorid of lime, U. S. P. strength (30 per cent available chlorin), 1 pound
to 3 gallons of water.</li>
<li>Formaldehyde, 1 quart 40 per cent solution to 5 gallons of water.</li>
<li>A 3 per cent solution of cresol compound, U. S. P., or accepted substitute
therefor, containing at least 50 per cent cresylic acid.</li>
</ul>

<p>All stable utensils should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected by the
application of a solution of one of the above-named disinfectants. The manure
should be burned or disinfected and spread over ground (other than meadow land)
that is to be turned under. No other cattle should be purchased for at least
sixty days after the complete disinfection of the premises.</p>

<p>The success in eradicating the disease by combined quarantine, slaughter,
and disinfection, as practiced in the United States, Den<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>mark, Great Britain,
and a few other countries, demonstrates in a striking manner the efficacy of
slaughtering and the futility of relying upon quarantine alone to stamp out the
disease.</p>

<p>Inoculation has been adopted in some countries in order to have the disease
spread quickly through the herds, and while this practice has undoubted value
where the disease is indigenous, it is not desirable in this country and should
not be adopted.</p>

<p>As a rule medicinal treatment with a view of curing affected animals is not
to be recommended under conditions prevailing in the United States, where the
disease has not become established, and the first object is to stamp it out as
quickly as possible. Even though most animals would recover, with or without
treatment, it would be practically impossible, while they were being held for
recovery, to prevent the spread of the infection to others. The disease would
be liable to spread faster than it could be cured. As already pointed out, it
has been found impossible to prevent absolutely the spread of the contagion by
the strictest quarantine alone, under the usual farm conditions. In addition,
the affected animals that have passed through the disease may become a source
of further infection as virus carriers for weeks and months after they have
apparently recovered, and are susceptible of reinfection, as one attack does
not confer permanent immunity.</p>

<p><em>Foot-and-mouth disease in man</em>.&mdash;Foot-and-mouth disease is primarily and
principally a disease of cattle; secondarily and casually, a disease of man.
It is transmissible to man through the eating or drinking of raw milk,
buttermilk, butter, cheese, and whey from animals suffering from foot-and-mouth
disease. It is also transmitted directly, though more rarely, from the salivary
secretions or other infected material which may gain entrance through the
mucous membrane of the mouth. It is doubtful whether the disease can be
transmitted to man by cutaneous or subcutaneous inoculation, though it is
probable that the infection may be communicated if the virus directly enters
the blood through wounds of any kind. Children are not infrequently infected by
drinking unboiled milk during the periods in which the disease is prevalent in
the neighborhood, while persons in charge of diseased animals may become
infected through contact with the diseased parts or by milking, slaughtering,
or caring for the animals.</p>

<p>The symptoms in man resemble those observed in animals. There is fever,
sometimes vomiting, painful swallowing, heat and dryness of the mouth, followed
by an eruption of vesicles on the mucous membrane of the mouth, and very rarely
by similar ones on the fingers. The vesicles appear on the lips, gums, cheek,
and edge of the tongue, and are about the size of a pea. The vesicles soon
rupture, leaving a small erosion which is soon covered by a thin crust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>under
which the new formation of epithelium proceeds rapidly. The skin eruption
mostly appears on the hands, tips of the fingers, base of the nails, and more
seldom on the toes and other parts of the body. Besides these local changes,
during the course of the disease headache, pain in the limbs, vertigo,
abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness are occasionally observed.
The disease is seldom fatal, usually appearing in a very mild form except in
weakened children, in whom an accompanying intestinal catarrh may lead to a
fatal termination.</p>

<p>Veterinarians who have had considerable experience with the disease among
animals regard the human affection as by no means uncommon in countries where
foot-and-mouth disease prevails, but the disturbance of health is usually too
slight to come to the notice of the family physician.</p>

<p>But few outbreaks of the disease in man have occurred in the United States,
and therefore cases of its transmission to man in this country are rather rare.
Dr. James Law reports having observed the disease in man from drinking infected
milk during the epizootic of 1870 in the Eastern States, but the outbreaks of
1880 and 1884 affected such a small number of animals and were so quickly
suppressed that no instance of its transmission to man was recorded. A few
cases have been reported by Brush accompanying the New England outbreak of
1902. Similar reports have been likewise received concerning the appearance of
vesicular eruptions in the mouths of children during the 1908 and 1914
outbreaks, and the history of these cases incriminates the milk supply.</p>

<p>Experiments by Loeffler and Froesch, as well as recent experiments which
have been made in Denmark and Germany, indicate that the infection is
comparatively easy to destroy by heat or the usual antiseptics. Milk
pasteurized at a temperature of 60Â° C. for 20 minutes is safe so far as
infection by foot-and-mouth disease is concerned.</p>

<h4>SEPTICEMIA AND PYEMIA.</h4>

<p>These two names are applied to diseased conditions which are so nearly alike
in their symptoms that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the one from
the other. Indeed, the name pyosepticemia, or septicopyemia, is often applied
when it is impossible to make a distinction between septicemia and pyemia or
where each is equally responsible for the diseased condition. The name
septicemia is derived from two Greek words meaning "poison" and "blood," and
signifies that the germ lives in the blood, hence the use of the term "blood
poisoning" for this disease. Pyemia is likewise derived from two Greek words,
meaning "pus" and "blood," and is that form of septicemia caused by
pus-producing organisms and characterized by secondary abscesses.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Causes</em>.&mdash;Neither of these diseases is brought about, strictly speaking,
by any specific organism; hence neither can be looked upon as a specific
disease. The organisms most frequently found in cases of septicemia are, on the
whole, the same as those of pyemia, and may be pus cocci, the bacillus coli, or
other pus-producing organisms. These organisms are often found as secondary
invaders in other diseases, such as advanced cases of tuberculosis, in which
cases they are responsible for the formation of pus.</p>

<p>Aside from the causative organism, or, in other words, the active cause,
there are many secondary causes. The most important of these in pyemia is a
break in continuity of the protective covering, as a wound, which affords an
entrance into the tissues for the organisms. Among the different varieties of
wounds may be mentioned cuts, bruises, punctures, burns, chemical or frozen
wounds, and compound fractures of bones. Injuries received during parturition,
stoppage of the milk ducts, and infection of the umbilicus in the newly born
are also frequent causes of pyemia. Septicemia usually follows surgical wounds,
local suppuration, enteritis, bronchitis&mdash;in fact, wherever there is a
local lesion of any kind permitting germs to enter the blood. Septicemia was
formerly applied to designate the condition in which the organisms were
localized, but in which their toxins were diffused in the blood. Pyemia was
made to represent that condition when the organisms were localized, but in
which the pus was transported by the blood. These terms now are applied to
conditions in which both the organisms and their toxins, or the pus, are
present in the blood. The term septicemia is indicated when intoxication is the
more pronounced symptom and pyemia if pus formation and metastatic or secondary
abscess formation are observed.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of both diseases include primarily a high fever
(104Â° to 107Â° F.). Coupled with this there is disinclination to move, the
animal is depressed and not cognizant of its surroundings. The pulse is rapid,
small, and feeble, respiration increased, mucous membrane injected, swollen,
and of a yellowish tinge. Appetite is lost and death follows in the case of
septicemia in from two to four days. In pyemia the symptoms come on more slowly
and are not so intense as in septicemia, while the course of the disease is
longer, lasting from six days to four weeks. The mortality is not so great as
in septicemia, but the period of convalescence is always long.</p>

<p><em>Lesions</em>.&mdash;Septicemia is characterized by the destructive changes in the
blood, which is chocolate colored, noncoagulable, and swarms with bacteria. The
lining membranes of the heart are studded with red spots, often running
together to form a large hemorrhagic area. The lungs, liver, and kidneys may
also show these hemorrhages. The spleen is enlarged and full of black blood.
The cadaver de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a>
</span>composes very rapidly and in some cases forms great quantities of
fetid gas. In pyemia, in addition to these lesions, abscesses are formed in the
various organs throughout the body. If the disease develops slowly a
post-mortem examination shows the abscesses to be the chief alterations. The
pus content is usually greenish, stained with blood, and contains strings of
fibrous tissue and necrosed matter.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is almost futile in advanced cases of either
disease. Septicemia is usually fatal and pyemia frequently so. Prevention and
the immediate treatment of local infections are the surest means of combating
them. For local treatment of wounds the usual antiseptics are indicated, such
as 3 per cent compound cresol or carbolic acid, or one one-thousandth
bichlorid-of-mercury solution. For pyemia, where the abscesses are near the
skin, they should be opened and treated antiseptically by injecting any of the
previously mentioned germicides. General and heart stimulants are indicated,
such as a drench containing digitalis 2 drams and alcohol 2 ounces. Quinin and
calomel in repeated small doses of one-half dram each three times a day are
sometimes beneficial. Camphor in the form of oil of camphor (camphor dissolved
in 10 parts of sweet oil) is a good stimulant and has some antiseptic
properties, which make it a valuable drug in combating these diseases when it
is given in doses of 2 drams three times daily.</p>

<h4>HEMORRHAGIC SEPTICEMIA.</h4>

<p>Hemorrhagic septicemia is a name applied to a highly fatal, infectious
disease existing in various species of domestic and wild animals, from a
microorganism having definite biological characters and possessing the
properties of producing clearly defined and characteristic lesions.</p>

<p>This causal agent, <em>Bacterium bovisepticum</em>, belongs to the same group of
cocco-bacilli as those causing chicken cholera, swine plague, and rabbit
septicemia, and may be described as an ovoid, nonmotile, polar-staining
bacterium with rounded ends, 1/38000 of an inch wide by 1/20000 of an inch
long, sometimes seen in pairs and sometimes in chains.</p>

<p>Various names have been applied to this disease, and though the causative
agent and the distinctive lesions are well known, it is more than likely that
the affection is seldom recognized. It was described by Bollinger in 1878, and
named Wild und Rinderseuche, from its having affected deer, wild boars, cattle,
and horses in an epizootic which swept over Germany at that time. Before this,
however, several epizootics of what was evidently the same disease had been
well described, notably that which occurred in England in 1854. Since then it
has occurred in epizootic and enzootic forms in many sections <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> of Europe, Asia, Africa,
and America. In this country the disease has been observed in Texas, Tennessee,
New York, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, South Dakota, and
Wisconsin. Other names given to it are game and cattle disease, buffalo
disease, barbone, pasteurellosis bovina, ghotwa, and infectious pneumoenteritis.</p>

<p>In earlier times it was evidently confounded with gloss anthrax, and even
now it is probably mistaken in a great many instances for anthrax, blackleg,
cornstalk disease, and cerebrospinal meningitis.</p>

<p>The disease is essentially a septicemia, or blood poisoning, and the
microbic invasion occurs from inoculation probably either through abrasions of
the skin or by injury to the mucous membranes from coarse fodder, etc. Moore
and Smith have found in the mouths and nasal cavities of healthy animals,
including cattle, bacteria belonging to this group; but these organisms proved
to be nonpathogenic. As is well known, however, many pathogenic germs at times
exist in a saprophytic state, and it is not hard to conceive how a microbe may
cease such existence and assume parasitic or pathogenic properties when the
surroundings are eminently favorable. This may be a connecting link in the
etiology of sporadic outbreaks of the disease in which all other hypotheses as
to its genesis seem untenable. The disease seems to occur most frequently in
swampy or mucky localities or in pastures receiving the overflow from infected
fields. It is said to occur usually in the spring of the year, when the melting
snows and rains bring to the surface the subterranean waters from rich soils
containing nitrogenous materials in which the bacteria have been existing. In a
great many instances there does not seem to be any plausible explanation for an
outbreak of the disease and one can only surmise as to its origin.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Three forms of the disease are recognized, based
upon the distribution of the lesions&mdash;the superficial, or cutaneous, the
pectoral, or thoracic, and the intestinal form. The last is a usual accompaniment
of the other two and may be mild or severe. Naturally the symptoms vary according
to the violence of the attack and to the particular form of disease with which
the animal is affected. In the superficial, or cutaneous, form the presence of a
swollen tongue, throat, and dewlap, or even of the lower portion of the legs,
gives us a clew to the trouble. An entire loss of appetite occurs, and in milk
cows there is a diminution of the milk secretion. The temperature may be only
slightly elevated, but it is usually very high. Salivation is set up by the
inflammation of the mouth and pharynx. Unsuccessful efforts at eating and
swallowing are made. There may be difficulty in breathing, depending on the
amount of involvement of the larynx, trachea, bronchi, or lungs. There may be a
blood-stained discharge from the nostrils, and the mucous membrane thereof will
often show punctiform hemorrhages. The pulmonary form shows <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>the same symptoms
as croupous pneumonia, with a frequent suffocative cough and oppressed
breathing, or dyspnea. When the intestines are involved the patient strains to
defecate, and passes shreds of intestinal mucus along with blood-stained feces.
The urine also may be tinged with blood. Finally a severe diarrhea takes place,
the animal becomes correspondingly weak, and death takes place in 24 to 36
hours. Cases may die in as short a period as six to eight hours, while in the
pectoral form of the disease the animal may linger six or eight days. Cases
have been reported which became chronic and in which death did not take place
for a month or more. In some of the cases running an acute course, symptoms of
toxemia are present; there is a lack of sensation of the skin, staggering gait,
trembling, eyes fixed, neck at times bent to one side, and the eyes showing a
wild expression. At times the animals appear as if in pain and look around at
the flanks. In the pectoral form they may stand with the forelegs wide apart in
evident effort to breathe more freely. Sometimes there is a champing of the
jaws and a very free flow of glairy saliva dropping from the mouth.</p>

<p>The prognosis is decidedly unfavorable and 80 to 90 per cent of the cases
result fatally.</p>

<p><strong>Lesions</strong>.&mdash;The characteristic lesions of hemorrhagic septicemia consist
of hemorrhagic areas in the subcutaneous, subserous, and muscular tissues, the
lymph glands, and the viscera; in fact, they are distributed more or less
widely throughout the body and vary in size from a mere speck to the diameter
of a half dollar or even larger. The superficial form presents itself first as
a doughy tumefaction of the skin about the region of the throat, neck, dewlap,
or legs, which pits on pressure. This tumefaction consists essentially of a
cerogelatinous exudate into the subcutaneous and intermuscular tissues.</p>

<p>Bloody extravasations may take place in subcutaneous tissues in various
places, but they are usually seen about the lower portion of the neck. The
mucous membranes and submucous tissues of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and
larynx become involved in the process and are greatly thickened, inflamed, and
infiltrated with serum. The mucous membrane becomes reddish purple, and that of
the nostrils may in addition show hemorrhagic spots on its surface. The
lymphatic glands in this region are also swollen and infiltrated with bloody
serum. The salivary glands are pale and dry. The pectoral type, though at times
existing alone, may coexist with the cutaneous form. The inflammatory edema
of the mouth extends to the mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchi,
producing an extensive thickening and a yellowish infiltration. The lung shows
interstitial thickening from the outpouring of serum into its meshes. It may
become pneumonic.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The diaphragm, heart sac, and heart walls show numerous hemorrhagic points
and larger bloody extravasations. Sometimes there is a serous pleurisy, with
more or less fibrinous exudate. In the intestinal form the submucous and
subperitoneal tissues show alterations from a few hemorrhagic spots to large
bloody suffusions, or even gelatinous infiltrations. This latter is seen about
the region of the pancreas and in the folds of the mesentery. There is a severe
hemorrhagic inflammation of the intestines and a staining of the intestinal
contents with blood. The muscular system throughout shows hemorrhagic areas.
The abdominal viscera, liver, spleen, and kidneys often present hemorrhagic
lesions.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;Anthrax, which presents superficial swellings,
like hemorrhagic septicemia, may be distinguished from that affection on
post-mortem examination by the enlargement and engorgement of the spleen, the
contents of which are soft and tarry. The blood of anthrax animals is very
dark, and does not become light red on exposure to air, nor does it coagulate,
while in hemorrhagic septicemia the blood is normal in appearance and
coagulates. The detection of the anthrax bacillus in the blood would be
final.</p>

<p>In blackleg the animals affected are usually under 2 years of age. The
swellings are quite evident, and usually occur on the legs, above the knees or
hocks, and are distended with gas, which crackles, or crepitates, when pressed
upon. If one of these tumors is opened, a bloody serum will exude, and the gas
gives off the odor of rancid butter. The internal hemorrhages are not general,
although they may occur. A microscopic examination of the juices from the
tumefaction will show the blackleg bacillus.</p>

<p>In cerebrospinal meningitis the causative agent is unknown, but probably
exists in the feed. It may occur in any locality and at any season of the year.
There are no local swellings, and cattle are not frequently affected.</p>

<p>Cornstalk disease may be differentiated from this affection from the fact
that it always occurs after the cattle are turned into a cornstalk field, by
its sudden onset, the absence of any characteristic symptoms or post-mortem
lesions, and the failure to find the causative agent in the blood.</p>

<p>In making a post-mortem examination of animals affected with hemorrhagic
septicemia, it would be well to examine the articular surfaces of the long
bones, as it has been reported that they are frequently ulcerated. This should
apply especially to those cases that have shown lameness.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is absolutely useless, so far as we know at
present, and for all practical purposes prophylaxis alone should be relied
upon. The same sanitary precautions, such as isolation, disinfection, and
burial or burning of all dead carcasses, should be <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>observed as for anthrax and
other highly infectious diseases. All the premises, barns, stalls, litter, and
stable utensils should be thoroughly disinfected. Separate the apparently well
animals from the sick by placing them in a separate lot.</p>

<p>Experiments by the Bureau of Animal Industry toward protective inoculation
of the exposed cattle on infected premises have been made and the results have
been so satisfactory that several commercial houses handling biological
products are manufacturing a vaccine for hemorrhagic septicemia in accordance
with the Government's experiments on this subject. The method of preparing the
vaccine is similar to that recommended by LigniÃ¨res. It consists in growing the
cultures of the organism of the disease at 42 to 43Â° C. and preparing from them
growing at this temperature two different strengths of vaccine. The weaker
vaccine, which is used for the first injection, is grown for five days at this
temperature, whereas the stronger vaccine, for the second injection, is grown
for only two days. These vaccines are used with an interval of 10 days between
the injections, the dose being 1 cubic centimeter at each injection. The effect
of this vaccine in abating outbreaks already in progress has been highly
satisfactory and it is plain that the general introduction of preventive
vaccination for hemorrhagic septicemia must be of material benefit to the
cattle raisers in the infected districts.</p>

<h4>VESICULAR ERUPTION OF THE GENITAL ORGANS.</h4>

<p>This contagious disease is called coital exanthema or vesicular exanthema,
and is more or less prevalent on the Continent. It has also been observed in
the breeding districts of the United States. It is the subject of legislation
in Germany, and governmental statistics are published annually concerning its
distribution in the Empire. According to the reports from Hungary 492 head of
cattle were attacked during 1898, 587 in 1899, and 207 in 1900.</p>

<p>A similar or perhaps identical disease of horses has the same distribution
and is transmissible from horses to cattle and vice versa.</p>

<p>The disease may be defined as a highly contagious eruption situated upon the
external genital organs of both sexes and accompanied with little or no general
disturbance of health. The contagion, the nature of which remains still
unknown, is transmitted mainly during copulation. The bull may have the disease
and convey it to all the cows with which he comes in contact, or he may become
infected by one cow, and, although not showing the disease, he may, during
copulation, transmit it for several days after to all other cows. Simple
contact between one cow and another may convey the disease, or the sponges used
in cleaning the diseased may carry the virus to the healthy. It has also been
conveyed to healthy cows by these animals lying with their hind quarters
against infected wooden troughs.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The period between the infection and the appearance of
symptoms is somewhat variable. It is usually given as three to six days. It may
be briefer or much longer. In cows the mucous membrane of the vagina and the
vulva become swollen, inflamed, very tender, and covered with dark-red spots.
The secretion is very abundant and consists at first largely of serum and mucus
resembling the white of an egg. Small vesicles then appear, which rapidly burst
and are converted into excoriations or deeper ulcerations. The secretion
becomes more purulent and is apt to dry in crusts about the root of the tail.
The eruption is accompanied with much itching and difficulty in urinating. The
walk may be stiff and awkward. In bulls the eruption is situated on the prepuce
and the end of the penis, and consists of pimples, vesicles, and ulcers, as in
cows. It is accompanied with a little purulent discharge from the prepuce,
itching, and difficulty in urinating. In severe cases the inflammation and
swelling may extend backward to the scrotum and forward upon the abdomen.</p>

<p>The disease lasts from one to four weeks and always terminates in recovery.
The acute stage lasts only four or five days, while the complete healing of the
inflammation is slow. The eruption is usually accompanied with very little
general disturbance. If the pain and irritation are severe, there may be some
light loss of appetite and diminished milk secretion in cows. The disease
rarely causes abortion. Chronic catarrh of the vagina and permanent sterility
frequently follow as sequelÃ¦.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em> need not be resorted to excepting in severe cases. The secretion
and exudation should be washed off and a mild antiseptic applied, such as a 1
per cent solution of carbolic acid (1 ounce to 3 quarts of water) or 2 per cent
solution of cresol compound in water. Care must be taken not to carry the
disease from the sick to the well by sponges, etc., which have come in contact
with the affected organs. These should be destroyed. To prevent the spread of
the disease the infected animals should be kept isolated until they have
recovered.</p>

<h4>RABIES OF CATTLE.</h4>

<p>Rabies is a disease preeminently affecting the canine race, although all
warm-blooded animals, including man, are susceptible to the malady, which is
always communicated through bites from a preceding case. It has required many
years of patient, scientific research to lead the ablest investigators to a
clear comprehension of the cause, nature, and characteristics of this
affection. It was known and described several centuries prior to the beginning
of the Christian era, and from the earliest dawn of history it has been feared
and dreaded. Its terrible manifestations have always been surrounded with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
atmosphere of awe and mystery, and it is not surprising that myths, fallacies,
and misconceptions in regard to it have been common and widely accepted. As the
investigations by which we have come to a tolerably clear understanding of the
facts concerning rabies have been comparatively recent, and for the most part,
have appeared in scientific periodicals, fallacies in regard to the disease
continue to have a strong hold upon the public mind. For instance, it is still
a widely prevalent belief that if persons or animals are bitten by a dog
they are liable to become rabid if the dog should contract the disease at any
future time. There is no foundation for this impression, and it would be a
great comfort to many people who are now and then bitten by animals if the
fallacy of this idea were known. All experience, both scientific and practical,
goes to show that rabies is transmitted only by animals that are actually
diseased at the time the bite is inflicted. Rabies is an infectious disease
involving the nervous system and characterized by extreme excitability and
other nervous disorders and always terminating in death. The contagion of this
disease has never been isolated, but the fact that it is caused by a specific
organism principally found in the nervous system is indisputable. For instance,
if an emulsion of the brain of a rabid animal is filtered through a germ-proof
filter, the filtrate will be harmless. This fact indicates that the infectious
principle is not in solution, but is an organism withheld from the filtrate by
the filter. This contagion can be propagated only in the body of an animal. It
is transmitted naturally from one animal to another solely by bites, and the
old idea of spontaneous appearance of the disease is absolutely fallacious. It
may be produced artificially by inoculating susceptible animals with an
emulsion of the brain or spinal cord, as well as the saliva, milk, and other
secretions of the affected animal. The blood, on the contrary, seems to be free
from the infectious principle. The saliva contains the virus, which, under
natural conditions, is introduced into or under the skin on the tooth of the
rabid animal. The disease is widespread, being found in many countries of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in certain sections of the United States.</p>

<p>Owing to the rigid quarantine regulations enforced against dogs imported
into Australia, that country remains absolutely free from the disease.
Following the canine race, cattle seem to be the most frequently affected,
probably because rabid dogs, next to their morbid desire to attack other
members of their own race, have a better opportunity to bite grazing cattle
than any other species of animal. The relative frequency of rabies in these two
species of animals is indicated by the carefully compiled statistics of the
German Empire, which shows that 904 dogs and 223 cows died of rabies in 1898,
while <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
in 1899 there were 911 cases in dogs and 171 in cattle. The latter
receive bites most frequently on the hind legs and in the hips and about the
lower jaw. These places are most accessible to dogs, owing to the habit of
cattle to drive their tormentors away by lowering their heads and using their
horns. Every animal bitten does not necessarily develop the disease, but the
per cent of fatalities has been variously estimated, and averages from 25 to
30. This, however, depends on the location and size of the wound as well as the
amount of hemorrhage produced, and various other conditions. In general, the
nearer the bite is located to the central nervous system and the deeper the
wound inflicted, the greater the danger of a fatal result. In cases in which
the hemorrhage resulting from the bite is profuse, there is a possibility that
the virus will be washed out of the wound and thus obviate the danger of
subsequent appearance of the disease.</p>

<p>The virus after being deposited in the wound remains latent for an extremely
variable period of time, which also depends on the size and depth of the wound
as well as its location and the amount of the virulent saliva introduced.
Experiments have proved that the virus follows the course of the nerves to the
spinal cord and along the latter to the brain before the symptoms appear.
Gerlach, having collected the statistics from 133 cases, has found this time,
known as the period of incubation, to vary from 14 to 285 days. The great
majority of cases, however, contract the disease in one to three months after
the bite has been inflicted.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;As in dogs, both furious and dumb rabies are met with, the
former being more common in cattle. A sharp line of distinction, however, can
not be drawn between these two forms of the disease, as the furious form
usually merges into the dumb, from the paralysis which appears prior to death.
The typical cases of dumb rabies are those in which the paralysis appears at
the beginning of the attack and remains until death. The disease first
manifests itself by a loss of appetite and rumination, stopping of the
secretion of milk, great restlessness, anxiety, manifestation of fear, and
change in the disposition of the animal. This preliminary stage is followed in
a day or two by the stage of excitation, or madness, which is indicated by
increasing restlessness, loud roaring at times with a peculiar change in the
sound of the voice, violent butting with the horns and pawing the ground with
the feet, with an insane tendency to attack other animals, although the desire
to bite is not so marked in cattle as in the canine race. A constant symptom is
the increased secretion of saliva with a consequent frothing at the mouth, or
the secretion may hang from the lips in long strings. Constipation is marked,
and there is manifested a continual, although unsuccessful, desire to defecate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Spasms of the muscles in different parts of the body are also seen at
intervals. About the fourth day the animal usually becomes quieter and the walk
is stiff, unsteady, and swaying, showing that the final paralysis is coming on.
This is called the paralytic stage. The loss of flesh is extremely rapid, and
even during the short course of the disease the animal becomes exceedingly
emaciated. The temperature is never elevated, it usually remaining about normal
or even subnormal. Finally, there is complete paralysis of the hind quarters,
the animal being unable to rise, and but for irregular convulsive movements
lies in a comatose condition and dies usually from the fourth to the sixth day
after the appearance of the first symptom.</p>

<p><em>Anatomy</em>.&mdash;If animals which have succumbed to rabies are examined post
mortem, very slight evidence of disease will be found in any of the organs,
and, indeed, the absence of any specific lesions may be considered as
characteristic. The blood is dark and imperfectly coagulated. The throat is
frequently reddened, and there may be small spots of extravasated blood in the
intestines. The stomachs are usually empty. In the spleen there may be
hemorrhagic enlargements (infarcts). The cadavers rapidly undergo
decomposition.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;It is not an easy matter to decide definitely
that a given animal has rabies, since the symptoms given above belong in
part to a variety of other diseases, among which may be mentioned the
excitement seen in young animals following close confinement, certain vegetable
and mineral poisons, acute enteritis, and alterations of the central nervous
system in cattle, the most common of which is tuberculosis of the brain and its
covering membranes. The post-mortem lesions, however, should assist in making a
correct diagnosis. Tetanus may readily be differentiated from rabies by the
persistence of muscular cramps, especially of the face and abdomen, which cause
these muscles to become set and as hard as wood. In tetanus there is also an
absence of a depraved appetite or of a willful propensity to hurt other animals
or to damage the surroundings. The cow remains quiet and the general muscular
contraction gives her a rigid appearance. There is an absence of paralysis
which marks the advanced stage of rabies. The form of dumb rabies in dogs is
characterized by the paralysis and pendency of the lower jaw, while in tetanus
the jaws are locked. This locking of the jaws in cattle renders the animal
incapable of bellowing, as in rabies. Finally, tetanus may be distinguished
from rabies by the fact that the central nervous system does not contain the
infectious principle, while in rabies the inoculation of test rabbits with the
brain or cord of a rabid animal will produce the disease with characteristic
symptoms after an interval of 15 to 20 days. This period of incubation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>is much
longer than in tetanus, since the inoculation of rabbits with tetanus cultures
invariably results in death after a short period and usually within three days.
The positive evidence that a rabid dog has been near cattle would greatly
assist in making a decision in doubtful cases.</p>

<p>The disease in dogs is pretty well recognized by most people, but in case a
suspected dog is killed it is desirable to open the animal and examine the
contents of the stomach. While feed is absent, a variety of odd things may be
present which the abnormally changed appetite of the rabid dog has induced it
to swallow. Among such things may be straws, sticks, glass, rags, earth, pieces
of leather, and whatever the animal may have encountered small enough to be
swallowed. This miscellaneous collection in the stomach of dogs, together with
absence of feed, is regarded by authorities as a very valuable sign, and in
case of doubt may be made use of by laymen. In important cases, however, the
head of the dog, cow, or other suspected animal should be removed and sent to
the nearest biological laboratory, where a positive diagnosis can be made
within 36 hours by the histological examination of the plexiform nerve ganglia,
and within two or three weeks by the intracerebral inoculation of rabbits with
an emulsion of the brain of the suspected animal.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;This is useless after the first appearance of symptoms.
When, however, a wound inflicted by a rabid animal can be discovered, it should
be immediately cauterized or even completely extirpated, care being taken to
cut entirely around the wound in the healthy tissues. For cauterizing the
wound, fuming nitric acid, the hot iron, and 10 per cent solution of zinc
chlorid are the most efficacious. To afford an absolute protection, this should
be done within a few moments after the bite has been inflicted, although even
as late as a few hours it has been known to thwart the development of
the disease.</p>

<p>Pasteur originated and perfected a system of preventive inoculation against
this disease which has greatly reduced the mortality in human subjects. Its
application to animals, however, is difficult and requires considerable time
and expense. A method of vaccination applicable to animals, consisting of a
single injection of a suspension of "fixed" rabies virus, is now being quite
extensively employed by veterinarians. Sanitary regulations which seek to
control effectively the disease by exterminating it among dogs are most likely
to prove successful. The measures which are adopted to this end can not be
discussed in this place, but it is a striking fact that where the muzzling of
all dogs has been rigidly enforced, as in England and in certain German
districts, the disease has been practically stamped out.</p>

<h4>TUBERCULOSIS.</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Pls.&nbsp;XXXIV</a>-<a href="#PLATE_XXXVIII">XXXVIII</a>.]</h5>

<p>Tuberculosis is an infectious and communicable disease characterized in its
early stages by the formation, in various organs of the body, of minute nodules
or tubercles, which contain <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, the cause of the
disease.</p>

<p>The disease, in its various manifestations, has been known for many
centuries, and legislative enactments having reference to the destruction of
affected animals and forbidding the use of the flesh date far back into the
Middle Ages. The opinions entertained regarding the nature and the cause of the
malady varied much in different periods and very markedly influenced the laws
and regulations in vogue. Thus, in the sixteenth century, the disease was
considered identical with syphilis in man. In consequence of this belief very
stringent laws were enacted, which made the destruction of tuberculous cattle
compulsory. In the eighteenth century this erroneous conception of the nature
of the disease was abandoned and all restrictions against the use of meat were
removed. Since that time, however, its communicable nature has been established
by many investigators, and the tide of opinion has again turned in favor of
repressing the disease and prohibiting the sale of contaminated products.</p>

<p><em>Occurrence</em>.&mdash;The statistics concerning tuberculosis show that it is a
disease prevalent in all civilized countries. In some countries, such as the
northern part of Norway and Sweden, on the steppes of eastern Europe and
Russia, in Sicily and Iceland, and in Algiers, it is said to be quite rare.</p>

<p>The returns from testing British cattle with tuberculin, supplied by the
Royal Veterinary College, as stated in March, 1900, showed that among 15,392
animals tested 4,105, or 26 per cent, reacted.</p>

<p>During the slaughter of cattle for pleuropneumonia careful examinations of
the carcasses were made for tuberculosis. Of 300 head killed near Edinburgh
120, or 40 per cent, were tuberculous. Of 4,160 killed in England 20 per cent
were tuberculous. Of one of these lots of cattle (451 animals) the president of
the Lancashire Farmers' Association testified that they were fairly
representative cattle&mdash;cows, heifers, and growing stock&mdash;a thoroughly mixed
lot; 20 per cent of them had tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Of 398 bovine animals taken haphazard in the city of Manchester, 120, or 30
per cent, were tuberculous. Among them were 168 cows, 69, or 41 per cent, being
tuberculous, and 2 having diseased udders.</p>

<p>The result of testing the Queen's herd at Windsor was that 36 out of 40, or
90 per cent, were found tuberculous.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The investigations made by the British Dairy Farmers' Association deserve
particular attention, coming as they do directly from a cattle owners'
organization. The council of this association "resolved to submit the general
consideration of the question to a committee, with a view to some more definite
understanding as to the possible extent to which tuberculosis exists in dairy
cattle." The secretary was instructed to write to a number of dairy farmers
being members of the association, asking their cooperation and the use of their
herds for the application of the tests. Of the herds offered, 9 were selected,
containing 461 cows and 12 bulls, and 188 of these animals reacted, being 40.8
per cent. There were among these cattle 335 Shorthorns, of which 119, or 35 per
cent, reacted; 67 crossbreds, of which 28, or 42 per cent, reacted; 47
Ayrshires, of which 37, or 80 per cent, reacted.</p>

<p>Another experiment of much interest is that of the Cheshire County Council.
The technical instruction committee set aside Â£250 to be used by a joint
committee from the agricultural and horticultural schools and Worleson Dairy
Institute for applying the tuberculin test to their herds. The tests were made
February 15, 1899. The results were: Worleson herd of 54 animals, 16 diseased,
or 29.6 per cent; agricultural school herd of 17 animals, 4 diseased, or 23.5
per cent. The Worleson herd consisted of Shorthorn cows. In each herd the
purebred Shorthorn bull was tuberculous. The results of the tuberculin test
were confirmed by the slaughter of the animals and examination of the
carcasses.</p>

<p>Sir T. D. G. Carmichael, member of Parliament for Midlothian, gave evidence
before the royal commission that his Polled Angus herd was tested in the spring
of 1895. "The results of the test were fearfully unexpected and alarming." Of
30 tested 13 showed decided reaction&mdash;43 per cent. Again, he speaks of
having 41 animals tested the same spring and 16 reacted&mdash;39.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Of 80 Shorthorn cattle intended for export which were tested 34 reacted, or
42 per cent.</p>

<p>Of a herd of 25 British Shorthorns recently tested in quarantine 40 per cent
were found tuberculous.</p>

<p>The addition of these animals above referred to gives 20,930 head examined
and 5,441, or 26 per cent, pronounced tuberculous. And these herds were not
selected because they were supposed to be tuberculous, but represent the
general cattle stock of the country. These animals included at least 470 head
of Shorthorns, of which 170, or 34 per cent, were tuberculous.</p>

<p>To these facts may be added the evidence of Prof. Bang that in the first
half of the nineteenth century tuberculosis was brought to Denmark by cattle
from Switzerland, Schleswig, and England, and that the same thing is now going
on in Sweden and Norway, particularly through English cattle. Also the evidence
of M. Sivori, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
chief of section at the ministry of agriculture, Argentina, who has investigated
tuberculosis in that country and who says that "30 or 40 years ago tuberculosis
was unknown in Argentine cattle, and it is still unknown among the native
(criollo) cattle. Its appearance dates from the introduction of pure breeding
animals. Statistics prove that tuberculosis is observed among the grades&mdash;
above all among those of the Durham and less among the Hereford."</p>

<p>Moreover, the reports of the royal commission of Victoria, Australia, and of
the New Zealand department of agriculture show a large proportion of
tuberculous cattle in those colonies, where the disease was almost certainly
carried by British cattle.</p>

<p>In the same manner that tuberculosis has been carried from Great Britain to
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Argentina, and Australia, it has also been taken to
Canada. In one herd of imported cattle slaughtered in the Canadian quarantine
station, 13 of the 14 animals were found tuberculous. One of the largest
Shorthorn herds in Canada was some time ago tested because an animal from it
was condemned when offered for shipment to the United States. This herd was
found to be very badly affected, and an effort is being made to eradicate the
disease by the Bang method. A Canadian official publication says of another
Shorthorn herd, which at one time had a very high reputation, that when an
investigation in regard to tuberculosis was recently made the disease was found
among ordinary cattle wherever animals from this herd had been introduced, and
that this herd, which had been looked upon as one of the greatest benefits to
the farming community, was really a danger, because it disseminated
tuberculosis among the farmers' herds. Still another well-known herd recently
attracted attention because four animals from it offered for export to the
United States were all tuberculous.</p>

<p>From December 23, 1900, to February 19, 1901, the period that the department
inspector tested all Canadian cattle intended for shipment to the United
States, 140 purebred Shorthorns and 3 Shorthorn grades were tested, and of the
total number 26, or 18 per cent, reacted. During the first month that this
inspection was enforced, and when it may be assumed that the condition of the
cattle most nearly represented what it had previously been, 74 cattle were
offered for importation, and 18, or 24.3 per cent, were found tuberculous.</p>

<p>In justice to Shorthorn cattle it should be said in this connection that
they are probably no more susceptible to tuberculosis than are other breeds,
but the disease has been allowed to spread in certain herds and families to
such an extent as to give a wrong impression concerning the breed as a
whole.</p>

<p>The slaughterhouse statistics of Prussia show 14.6 per cent of the cattle
and 2.14 per cent of the hogs to be tuberculous. In Saxony the percentage is
29.13 with cattle and 3.10 with hogs. In the city of Leipzig the figures are
36.4 for cattle and 2.17 for hogs. (Siedamgrotzky.) Of 20,850 animals in
Belgium tested with tuberculin in 1896, 48.88 per cent reacted. (Stubbe.) Of
25,439 tested in Den<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">
[Pg 410]</a></span>mark from 1893 to 1895, 49.3 per cent reacted; and of
67,263 tested from 1896 to 1898, 32.8 per cent reacted. (Bang.)</p>

<p>Figures available in the United States allow us to make a reliable estimate
of the extent of tuberculosis of cattle. The following summary is presented:</p>

<p>Reports of tuberculin tests made on 400,000 cattle in the United States
during the years 1893 to 1908 by Federal, State, and other officers with
tuberculin prepared by the Bureau of Animal Industry show 37,008 reactions, or
9.25 per cent. These were mostly dairy cattle, and in some cases herds were
suspected of being diseased.</p>

<p>Later reports of tuberculin tests made in the United States from July 1,
1917, to March 1, 1922, on 3,911,546 cattle by State, county, and Federal
officers engaged in cooperative tuberculosis eradication work showed 153,046
reactions, or 3.9 per cent.</p>

<p>All cattle in the District of Columbia, numbering 1,701, were tested with
tuberculin in 1909-10, and 18.87 per cent reacted. In 1909-11 herds in Maryland
and Virginia supplying milk to the District of Columbia were tested, with 19.03
and 15.38 per cent of reactions, respectively, among 4,501 cattle.</p>

<p>All cattle in the District of Columbia were tuberculin tested in 1920-21,
numbering 1,313, and 5 animals reacted, or 0.4 per cent, demonstrating that
tuberculosis may be eradicated from all the herds in a circumscribed area.</p>

<p>The beef cattle of the United States show a much smaller proportion of the
disease than dairy cattle, though the percentage of cattle found tuberculous in
the Government meat-inspection service has increased considerably in recent
years. This increase is due partly, but not wholly, to more stringent
inspection. Of 7,781,030 adult cattle slaughtered under Federal inspection
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1911, 76,448 were found tuberculous, a
percentage of 0.98.</p>

<p>From the statistics above referred to, and other data, it appears that in
the more densely populated areas of Europe and America from 5 to 50 per cent of
the dairy cattle are more or less affected with tuberculosis, while the proportion
of beef cattle affected is distinctly less, ranging from 0.14 to 30 per cent.
This difference is due to a number of causes. Beef cattle average younger when
slaughtered. They are not so frequently stabled, and are for that reason less
liable to infection, and as the males constitute a large proportion of this
class of animals the effect of milk secretion in lowering the vital forces is
not so apparent. In the United States it has been estimated that about 10 per
cent of the dairy cattle are tuberculous, while only about 2 per cent of the
beef cattle are so infected.</p>

<p><em>Cause and nature of the disease</em>.&mdash;The cause of tuberculosis is the
tubercle bacillus, which gains entrance to the body, lodges somewhere in the
tissues, and begins to grow and multiply at that point. As this bacillus
vegetates and increases in numbers it excretes substances which act as
irritants and poisons and which lead to the formation of a small nodule, called
a tubercle, at the point of irritation. As the bacilli are disseminated through
the animal body they affect many parts and cause the formation of an enormous
number of tubercles. By the union of such tubercles, masses of tubercular
material are formed, which in some cases are of great size. The disease is
called <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
tuberculosis because it is characterized by the formation of these
peculiar nodules, and the bacillus which causes the disease is for the same
reason known technically as the <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly predisposing conditions which contribute toward the
development of the disease; some of these are found in the animal body and
others in the environment. An enfeebled condition caused by insufficient feed,
exposure to great extremes of atmospheric temperature and insanitary
surroundings, or the drain occasioned by heavy production of milk, appear to
aid the development of the bacillus, and there is also a special individual
susceptibility in some cases which may be otherwise described as an inability
of the animal tissues to resist and destroy the bacilli when they have
penetrated to the inner recesses of the body.</p>

<p>Among the conditions of environment which aid the development of
tuberculosis may be mentioned stabling with lack of ventilation, damp
buildings, the keeping of many animals together, drafts of air which cause
colds and catarrhs, and, in general, everything which prevents the animals from
developing and maintaining the highest condition of health. None of these
conditions of body or environment are sufficient to cause the disease, however,
unless the animals are exposed to the <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and it
penetrates the tissues of their bodies.</p>

<p>The ways in which the tubercle bacilli find their way into the body may be
considered under four heads: (1) By inhalation into the lungs; (2) by taking
into the digestive tract in the milk of tuberculous cows or with other
contaminated feed; (3) during coition when the sexual organs are tuberculous; (4)
from the tuberculous mother to the fetus in the uterus. The bacilli can reach
the lungs by inhalation only when the bacilli are thoroughly dried and
pulverized and in condition to be carried by currents of air.</p>

<p>It is well known that the bacilli withstand drying for months before they
lose their power of producing disease. They leave the bodies of diseased
animals in several ways. There may be a little discharge occasionally coughed
up as a spray from the diseased lungs, or this material may be swallowed and
the bacilli carried off with the excrement, or milk may be spilt, or there may
be a discharge from the vagina when the genital organs are tuberculous. There
may also be ulcers of the intestines, from which many bacilli escape with the
feces. The bacilli from these sources may become dried and pulverized and
carried in the air of the stable and into the lungs of still healthy cattle,
where the disease then develops.</p>

<p>The disease of the stomach, intestines, and mesenteric glands is very
probably the result of feed infection. Tubercle bacilli may have been scattered
upon the feed by diseased animals, but the most common source of such infection
is the milk of tuberculous cows. Calves may become infected in this way. The
disease may remain latent until the animal becomes older. The not-infrequent
occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
rence of tuberculosis of the uterus and ovaries makes it probable that the
disease may be transmitted by a diseased bull or carried by a healthy one from
a diseased cow to a number of healthy cows.</p>

<p>The source of infection is always some previous case of the disease, for the
disease can never rise spontaneously; hence, in those stables in which there is
frequent change of cattle the introduction of tuberculosis by cattle coming
from other infected stables is the most frequent source of infection. Since the
bacilli when dried can be carried by the air, it is not necessary that healthy
animals come in direct contact with cases of disease to become infected. In
general, the greatest number of cases occur in the immediate environment of
cities, where there are not only abundant opportunities for infection, owing to
the frequent introduction of new animals into herds, but where the sanitary
conditions may be regarded as the poorest.</p>

<p>The bacillus of tuberculosis was discovered by Robert Koch in 1882. It is a
slender, rodlike body (see <a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Pl. XXVIII</a>, fig. 6) from
one-third to two-thirds the diameter of a red blood corpuscle in length. As
already explained, when the bacillus has become lodged in any organ or tissue
it begins to multiply, and thereby causes an irritation in the tissue around
it, which leads to the formation of the so-called tubercle. The tubercle, when
it has reached its full growth, is a little nodule about the size of a millet
seed. It is composed of several kinds of tissue cells. Soon a change takes
place within the tubercle. Disintegration begins, and a soft, cheesy substance
is formed in the center, which may contain particles of lime salts. When these
tubercles continue to form in large numbers they run together, forming masses of
various sizes. The disintegration which attacks them leads to the formation of
large cheesy masses of a yellowish color, containing more or less of lime salts
in the form of gritty particles. These large tuberculous masses are surrounded
by or embedded in layers of fibrous tissue which in some cases becomes very
dense and thick.</p>

<p>The disease is thus a development of these tubercles in one or more organs
of the body. The distribution and number of the tubercles determine the course
of the disease.</p>

<p>In a large number of cases the changes are limited to the lungs and the
serous membranes<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the thorax and abdomen.
Pathologists have been in the habit of calling the lung disease tuberculosis
and the disease of the serous membranes "pearly disease." Statistics have shown
that in about one-half of the cases both lungs and serous membranes are
diseased, in one-third only the lungs, and in one-fifth only the serous
membranes. At the same time the lymphatic glands near the diseased organs are
usually involved. Other organs, such as the liver, not infrequently contain
tubercles. Though the disease <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">
[Pg 414]</a></span>may remain restricted to a single organ, it now
and then is found generalized, affecting all organs of the body.</p>

<p>In the lungs (<a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Pl. XXXIV</a>) the changes observed
vary according to the age and intensity of the disease process. They usually
begin with the appearance of very minute tubercles. These may appear in large
numbers on the surface of the lungs or within the lung tissue. Later the
contents become cheesy and partly calcified. When these tubercles are
sufficiently numerous to become confluent, large masses may be formed, which
undergo the same retrogressive changes of caseation and calcification. In
addition to the formation of tubercles in the lung tissue, certain other
changes take place. There is usually bronchitis with abundant catarrhal
secretion; this plugs up the smaller air tubes, and the lung tissue supplied
with air by the tubes collapses. Subsequently it becomes filled with yellowish,
cheesy matter, which greatly distends the small air tubes and air vesicles
(bronchopneumonia). The connective tissue between the lung lobules, around the
tubercles, and around the air tubes becomes thickened and indurated. In the
larynx and the bronchi tubercles may vegetate upon the mucous membrane, and
ulcers may result from their breaking down. The inflammatory irritation which
the growth of the tubercles on the surface of the lungs arouses gives rise to
adhesion of the lungs to the ribs and diaphragm. This adhesion is sometimes so
firm and extensive that the lungs appear grown to the chest wall.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the lungs in advanced stages of the disease are cut open we
observe large yellowish masses, from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch
in diameter, of a cheesy texture, in which calcified, gritty particles are
embedded and which are surrounded by very firm connective tissue. The
neighboring lung tissue, when collapsed and involved in bronchopneumonia, has
the color and consistency of pale-red flesh. The air tubes, large and small,
stand out prominently on the cut surface. They are distended with a pasty,
yellowish, cheesy mass, surrounded and enveloped in thick mucus, and their
walls greatly thickened. The larger bronchi may be sacculated, owing to the
distention produced by the cheesy contents.</p>

<p>The disease usually attacks the bronchial glands, which are situated on the
trachea and bronchial tubes at the bifurcation. The changes in the glands are
the same as those going on in the lung tissue, and they frequently reach an
enormous size.</p>

<p>The tubercle formation on the serous membranes covering the lungs and chest
wall (<a href="#PLATE_XXXVII">Pl. XXXVII</a>, fig. 2), which may go on at the
same time with the lung disease or independent of it, has been called "pearly
disease," on account of the peculiar appearance of the tubercles. These begin
as very minute, grayish nodules, which give the originally smooth, lustrous
membrane a roughened appearance. These minute tubercles enlarge, become
confluent, and project above the surface of the membrane as wartlike masses,
attaining the size of peas. In this stage their attachment to the membrane is
by means of delicate fibers. The attachment is loose, so that the tubercle
hangs <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
by a short pedicle or neck and may be moved slightly to and fro. Large
masses are frequently formed by a coalescence of many tubercles and the
secondary formation of the same. These may be found on the lungs, the ribs, and
the diaphragm. These tubercles likewise undergo degenerative changes. The
center partly softens and partly calcifies into a grayish mortarlike mass, and
is gritty. Associated with the formation of tubercles on the pleura, those
glands situated back of the center of the lungs between the two main lobes
(posterior mediastinal) become greatly enlarged and the center cheesy.
(<a href="#PLATE_XXXVI">Pl. XXXVI</a>, fig. 1.) They may compress the esophagus
and interfere with swallowing. The size attained by these tumors and new
growths is well illustrated by the fact that, taken together, they not
infrequently weigh from 60 to 80 pounds. The bronchial glands, which in the
healthy state are not so large as horse-chestnuts, have been found to attain a
weight of more than 10 pounds.</p>

<p>In the abdominal cavity tubercles may be found, both in the organs and on
the serous membranes covering them. They are situated usually on the omentum,
or caul (see <a href="#PLATE_XXXVI">Pl. XXXVI</a>, fig. 2), the diaphragm, and
the walls of the abdomen. In the liver large and small tubercular masses are
occasionally encountered. (See <a href="#PLATE_XXXV">Pl. XXXV</a>.) The
mesenteric glands are occasionally enlarged and tuberculous; likewise the
glands near the liver. Tubercles may also develop in the spleen, the kidneys,
the uterus and ovaries, and the testicles.</p>

<p>Tubercular affection of the intestines seems to be quite rare, although
ulcers of the large intestines have been observed. Nodules may also form under
the serous covering of the intestines.</p>

<p>The brain and spinal cord are occasionally found tuberculous. Of 40 cases,
Semmer found tuberculosis of the brain in 4. It is not improbable that, owing
to the infrequency of exposing the brain and spinal cord, tuberculosis may have
escaped the attention of pathologists, and it may be that it is not so uncommon
as is generally supposed. The tubercles occur on the membranes of the brain as
well as in the substance of the brain itself. They project into the ventricles
as masses, varying in size from a pinhead to a hen's egg. They finally lead to
various inflammatory changes. JÃ¶hne has observed numerous small tubercles on
the membranes of the spinal cord.</p>

<p>Very rarely tuberculous lesions have been observed in the bones and muscles
of the body. Not so rare, however, is the affection of the lymphatic glands
embedded in the muscular tissue, and those which can be felt beneath the skin.
These are situated at the joints, under the jaw, and along the neck.</p>

<p>Of late tubercular disease of the udder in cows (<a
href="#PLATE_XXXVIII">Pl. XXXVIII</a>) has received considerable attention
from sanitarians, owing to the infection of the milk with the virus of
tuberculosis. According to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">
[Pg 416]</a></span>those who have given this subject special attention,
the udder becomes swollen uniformly and quite firm. This swelling, which is
painless, frequently attacks but one quarter, more rarely two, these being
usually the hind quarters. The larger milk ducts contain yellowish, cheesy
particles, in which are many tubercle bacilli. Later larger nodules can be felt
within the udder, which undergo the various changes to which tubercles are
subject. The udder may grow very hard to the touch and become very large,
weighing in some cases up to 40 pounds. The milk, at first normal, becomes thin
and watery after a month or so, and is mixed with flakes and tubercle
bacilli.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The beginning of the disease usually passes unnoticed,
inasmuch as it is very slow and insidious and rarely accompanied with fever.
When the lungs are involved a dull, short cough is noticed, which may later on
become prolonged, convulsive, and very troublesome to the animal. The cough is
more frequent in the morning after movement and drinking. The breathing varies.
Only when much of the lung tissue is diseased is it labored and accompanied
with active movements of the chest and nostrils. Discharge from the nose is
rare or absent. At times, however, when the tubercles have broken down and
cavities containing cheesy masses have formed in the lung tissue, or when the
air tubes have become filled with cheesy and mucous masses, coughing will
dislodge them and cause their discharge. In advanced stages the breath may have
a disagreeable odor. Pressure on the chest wall may give rise to pain.</p>

<p>The general effect on the body is at first slight. In fact, animals may
remain in good flesh for a considerable time. Invariably as the disease
progresses loss of flesh and appetite and paleness of the mucous membranes
become manifest. These symptoms are accompanied with a gradual diminution of
the milk secretion. The debilitated condition of the animal is also manifested
by a staring coat and a tough, dry, harsh skin (hidebound). Digestive
disturbances are indicated by tympanites, or distention of the rumen by gas,
colic, and diarrhea, alternating with constipation. The animal generally dies
from exhaustion after a period of sickness which may last months or even
years.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis in the abdominal organs is often signalized by abortion and by
abnormal sexual manifestations. When the brain is involved, the disease may
cause convulsions, unconsciousness, paralysis, as well as peculiar movements in
a circle, oblique position of the head, etc. Lydtin quotes the following
description of the disease as taken from a Swiss sanitary order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A dry, short, interrupted, hoarse cough, which the sick animals manifest,
especially in the morning at feeding time, still more after somewhat violent
exertion. At first these animals may be full blooded and lay on a considerable
amount of fat when well fed. As the disease progresses they grow thin and show
more and more those appearances which indicate diseased nutrition, such as a
staring, lusterless, disheveled coat; dirty, tense skin, which appears very
pale in those regions free from hair. The temperature of the skin is below
normal. The loss of fat causes sinking of the eyes in their sockets. They
appear swimming in water, and their expression is weak. The cough is more
frequent, but never or very rarely accompanied with discharge. The body
continues to emaciate, even with plenty of food and a good appetite, so that
the quantity of milk is small. At times in the early stages of the disease,
still more in the later stages, the diseased animals manifest considerable
tenderness when pressure is applied to the front or the sides of the chest by
coughing, moaning, etc. Often symptoms are wanting in spite of the existence of
the disease.</p>
</div>

<p>Lydtin also quotes at length a description of the abnormal sexual desire
occasionally observed among cows when affected with this disease.</p>

<p><em>Diagnosis</em>.&mdash;A disease so varied in its attack upon the different organs
of the body and in the extent of the disease process must necessarily lead to
mistakes when diagnosis is attempted by ordinary means of examination. It has
been confounded with the later stages of pleuropneumonia, with parasitic
diseases of the brain, the lungs, the intestines, and with actinomycosis. A
careful examination of the lungs by auscultation and percussion enables the
expert to locate large tuberculous masses, owing to dullness, loss of
respiratory murmur, and abnormal sounds, such as blowing, whistling, and
creaking. The majority of cases of tuberculosis in cattle, however, including
many in which the lungs are quite seriously involved, can not be detected in this
manner.</p>

</p>

<h4>THE TUBERCULIN TEST.</h4>

<p>The tuberculin test, which is marvelously accurate in its indications, has
been almost universally adopted for the detection of tuberculosis. Tuberculin
is a drug prepared by sterilizing, filtering, and concentrating the liquids in
which the tubercle bacillus has been allowed to vegetate. It contains the
cooked products of the growth of these bacilli, but no living bacilli;
consequently, when this substance is injected under the skin of an animal it is
absolutely unable to produce the disease, cause abortion, or otherwise injure
the animal. In case the injected animal is normal there is no more effect upon
the system than would be expected from the injection of sterile water; however,
if the animal is tuberculous, a decided rise of temperature will follow the use
of tuberculin by the subcutaneous method. This substance, discovered by Koch,
has the effect, when injected into the tissues of a tuberculous animal, of
causing a decided rise of temperature or other manifestations while it has no
such effect upon animals free from the disease. The value of tuberculin for
this purpose was tested during the years 1890 and 1891 by Guttman, Roeckl and
SchÃ¼tz, Bang and Salomonsen, Lydtin, JÃ¶hne and Siedamgrotzky, Nocard, and many
others. It was at once recognized as a most remarkable and accurate method of
detecting tuberculosis even in the early stages and when the disease had yet
made but little progress. It is now quite generally employed.</p>

<p>The tuberculin test came into existence through the most careful and
thorough scientific experimentation.</p>

<p>As a result of its use an accurate diagnosis may be established in more than
90 per cent of the cases tested. The relatively few failures in diagnoses are
included among two classes of cattle. The first class contains those that are
tuberculous, but which do not react either because of the slight effect of an
ordinary-sized dose of tuberculin on an advanced case of the disease with so
much natural tuberculin already in the system, or on account of a recent
previous test with tuberculin which produces a tolerance to this material,
lasting for about six weeks. The second class includes those that are not
tuberculous, but which show indications of a reaction as a result of (<em>a</em>)
advanced pregnancy, (<em>b</em>) the excitement of &oelig;strum, (<em>c</em>)
concurrent diseases, as inflammation of the lungs, intestines, uterus, udder,
or other parts, abortion, retention of afterbirth, indigestion, etc., (<em>d</em>)
inclosure in a hot, stuffy stable, especially in summer, or exposure to cold
drafts or rains, (<em>e</em>) any change in the method of feeding, watering,
or stabling of the animal during the test. Notwithstanding all these
possibilities of error, the results of thousands of tests show that in less
than 3 per cent of the cases tested do these failures actually occur. In the
first class the chances of error are decidedly reduced by the skilled
veterinarian by making careful physical examination and diagnosing clinically
these advanced cases, and by the injection of double or triple doses into all
recently tested cattle, with the taking of the after-temperature, beginning
two hours following the injection and continuing hourly for 20 hours.</p>

<p>It is therefore apparent that tuberculin should be applied only by or under
the direction of a competent veterinarian, capable <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>not only of injecting the
tuberculin but also of interpreting the results, and particularly of picking
out all clinical cases by physical examination. The latter observation is
extremely important and should always be made on every animal tested.</p>

<p>In the second class, where the temperature test is used, errors are avoided
by eliminating from the test those cases that are nearing parturition or are in
heat or show evidence of the previously mentioned diseases or exhibit
temperatures sufficiently high to make them unreliable for use as normal. Where
other methods of test are used these conditions do not have an important
bearing on the results. In addition, a satisfactory tuberculin must be used;
also an accurate thermometer and a reliable syringe, in order that a sufficient
dose of tuberculin may be given. Finally, the number of apparent errors of the
tuberculin test will be greatly diminished if a careful post-mortem examination
is made, giving especial attention to the lymph glands. This low percentage of
failures being the case, cattle owners should welcome the tuberculin test, not
only for their own interest but for the welfare of the public as well. Where
this method of diagnosing the disease has been adopted tuberculosis is
gradually being eradicated. Without its use the disease can not be controlled
and the owner is confronted with serious and continuous losses; with its use
the disease can be eradicated from the herd, a clean herd established in a few
years without very serious loss or hardship, and the danger of its spread to
man removed. Tuberculin may therefore be considered a most beneficial discovery
for the stock raiser.</p>

<p>Law has clearly stated the question when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Many stock owners still entertain an ignorant and unwarranted dread of the
tuberculin test. It is true that when recklessly used by ignorant and careless
people it may be made a root of evil, yet as employed by the intelligent and
careful expert it is not only perfectly safe, but it is the only known means of
ascertaining approximately the actual number affected in a given herd. In most
infected herds living under what are in other respects good hygienic conditions
two-thirds or three-fourths are not to be detected without its aid, so that in
clearing a herd from tuberculosis and placing both herd and products above
suspicion the test becomes essential. * * * In skilled hands the tuberculin
test will show at least nine-tenths of all cases of tuberculosis when other
methods of diagnosis will not detect one-tenth.</p>
</div>

<p>Probably the most popular objection to tuberculin is that it is too
searching, since it discovers cases in which the lesions are small and obscure.
While this fact is admitted, it should also be remembered that such a small
lesion to-day may break down and become widely disseminated in a relatively
short period. Therefore any cow affected with tuberculosis, even to a
slight degree, must be considered as dangerous not only to the other animals in
the herd but also to the consumer of her products.</p>

<p>In 1898 Bang, of Copenhagen, one of the highest European authorities, in his
paper presented to the Congress for the Study of Human and Animal Tuberculosis,
at Paris, said:</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Numerous tests made in almost every civilized country have demonstrated that
in the majority of cases tuberculin is an excellent means for diagnosing the
existence or nonexistence of the disease, but giving us no positive information
as to the extent to which the disease has progressed. When tuberculin produces
a typical reaction we may be almost sure that there exists in the body of the
animal a tubercular process. The cases in which a careful examiner has not
succeeded in finding it are very rare, and I am led to believe that when,
notwithstanding all the pains taken, it has escaped discovery, the reason is
that it is located in a portion of the body that is particularly inaccessible.
Nevertheless, it is not to be denied that a fever, entirely accidental and of
short duration, may in some rare cases have simulated a reaction. However this
may be, the error committed in wrongly condemning an occasional animal for
tuberculosis is of no practical consequence.</p>

<p>A worse aspect of the case is that there are some diseased animals in which
tuberculin fails to discover the existence of tuberculosis. In most of these,
no doubt, the deposits are old, insignificant, and generally calcified, or they
are cases where the disease is arrested and perhaps in process of recovery, and
which are possibly incapable of disseminating the contagion. But it is known
that there are cases, not altogether rare, where tuberculin fails to cause a
reaction in a highly tuberculous animal, and consequently one in which the
disease exists in an extremely contagious form. For this reason a clinical
examination should always be made of an animal which does not give a reaction
but which shows symptoms indicating that, notwithstanding the test, it may
suffer from tuberculosis.</p>
</div>

<p>Nocard, of Paris, wrote also in 1898 as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The degree of certainty of the indications furnished may be stated in
precise terms. <em>The observation of a clear reaction to tuberculin is
unequivocal; the animal is tuberculous</em>. The pretended errors imputed to the
method are explained by the extreme sensitiveness of the reagent, which is
capable of detecting the smallest lesion. It often requires prolonged and
minute researches in the depths of all the tissues to discover the few miliary
centers, the presence of which has been revealed. The reaction is absolutely
specific. In those cases where it is observed with animals which show lesions
of another disease (actinomycosis, hydatid disease, verminous bronchitis,
distomatosis), it may be affirmed that there exists, in addition to these
conspicuous changes, a tuberculous center which alone has provoked the
reaction.</p>

<p><em>The failure to react does not necessarily imply absence of tuberculosis</em>.
Such failures of tuberculin are very exceptional. They are seen most frequently
with animals affected with tuberculosis in a very advanced stage and made
evident by plain external signs. Sometimes, also, there are found at the
post-mortem examination of animals which have not reacted small fibrous or
calcified lesions in such a condition that one is tempted to believe them
cured. Whether sterile or not, these lesions have no tendency to increase, and
they are not very dangerous from the point of view of contagion.</p>
</div>

<p>These opinions of two eminent authorities, living in different countries,
after long experience of their own and after studying the results of the many
tests made in different parts of the world, should have great weight. They are
essentially the same throughout.</p>

<p>In 1897 Voges compiled statistics of tuberculin tests, the accuracy of which
had been determined by post-mortem examination. Of 7,327 animals tested, it
appeared that errors had been made with 204, or 2.78 per cent. In the work of
the Pennsylvania Live Stock Sanitary Board post-mortem examinations were made
on about 4,400 reacting cattle and the disease was found in all but 8 of those
which had given characteristic reactions.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The results of a much larger number of tests might be compiled at this time,
but they would not materially change the average of those already mentioned. It
is plain that tuberculin is a remarkably accurate test of tuberculosis, that
the animals which react may be safely considered as tuberculous, and that when
a careful clinical examination is practiced in addition to the test there are
few animals in a dangerous condition which escape detection.</p>

<p>The first questions asked by those who oppose the adoption of the tuberculin
tests are: Is this test infallible? and, if it is not infallible, why should it
be forced upon the cattle owners of the country?</p>

<p>In answer to these questions it may be said that tuberculin is not
absolutely infallible, and yet it is by far the best method of diagnosing
tuberculosis that has been discovered. It is much better than any test known
for pleuropneumonia when that disease was eradicated.</p>

<p>Practically all the animals that react are affected with tuberculosis and
should be separated from the herd, not only in the interest of the public, but
in the interest of the owner of the herd. The best authorities admit, after
studying many thousands of tests, that there are few, if any, mistakes made in
condemning cattle which show a typical tuberculin reaction. The errors are
principally in the other direction&mdash;that is, some tuberculous animals are
not discovered by the tuberculin test, but as the most dangerous of these may
be picked out by ordinary clinical examination this fault of tuberculin is not
so serious as it at first sight appears. This being the case, it should
not be necessary to force the tuberculin test upon owners. They should be
anxious to adopt it in their own interests and for the protection of their
patrons. There is to-day no greater danger to the cattle and hog industries
than that which confronts them in the form of tuberculosis, a disease already
widespread and rapidly extending. Furthermore, in view of the results revealed
by numerous tests covering vast numbers of animals, tuberculin must be
considered as harmless for healthy animals. It has also been clearly
demonstrated that tuberculin interferes in no way with the milking function in
healthy cattle; neither in the quantity of milk nor in butter-fat value has any
variation been detected. The conclusions of some of the best authorities on the
subject of its harmlessness to healthy animals are given below.</p>

<p>Nocard and Leclainche state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Direct experiments and observations collected by thousands show that the
tuberculin injections have no unfavorable effect. With healthy animals the
system is indifferent to the inoculation; with tuberculous animals it causes
slight changes which are not at all serious.</p>
</div>

<p>Bang has written as follows on this question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We will now consider the following question, a very important one, in the
application of tuberculin, viz: Can the reaction produce a worse condition in
tuberculous animals than before existed? Hess emphatically states that it can,
and on this account he earnestly warns against its application. My attention
has been directed to this question from the beginning. In my first publication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
on tuberculin injection I reported two cases in which acute miliary
tuberculosis was proved in two high-grade tuberculous cows several weeks after
the tuberculin injection. I then stated my suspicion that perhaps the
tuberculin injection had some connection with this, just as is often supposed
to be the case in human practice. With my present very large amount of material
for observation at hand I may express the following opinion: Such an acute
development of tuberculosis as a result of tuberculin injection is to be feared
only exceptionally, and then in cases of advanced tuberculosis. <em>It must not be
forgotten that acute miliary tuberculosis by no means rarely accompanies an
advanced tuberculosis of long standing</em>. It is therefore impossible to offer
strict proof of the causal connection with the injection, and only oft-repeated
observation could make this probable. In support of my view I offer the
following: In the course of the last three years I have made careful
post-mortem examinations of 83 tuberculous animals, which have been removed
from my experiment farm, Thurebylille. Among these were 18 (or, strictly
speaking, 23) high-grade tuberculous animals. I have been able to prove miliary
tuberculosis in only 4 of these. Among the others, which showed less developed
tuberculosis, I have never found miliary tuberculosis, and with very many I have
never found any sign of a more rapid development of the process. On the
contrary, it has been proved that the disease was restricted locally, often for
years, in spite of yearly repeated injections. Dissections were made at very
different periods after the injections&mdash;in 17 cases from 4 to 12 days
after the last test. In all of these cases earlier tests had been made months
or years before. In 28 cases the injection took place from 19 days to 2 months
before the butchering; in 3 of these cases earlier injections had been made. In
38 cases from two and one-half months to one year intervened between the last
injection and the dissection. Dissection gives the best explanation of this
question, but a clinical observation, continued for years, of a herd tested
with tuberculin can render very essential aid. If Hess's opinion is correct, it
is to be assumed that tuberculosis must take an unusually vicious course in
such herds, but this I have been unable to prove. At Thurebylille there has
existed for three years a reacting division, consisting originally of 131 head
and now 69. Although these animals are yearly tested, and although most of them
react every year, the division certainly appears to be made up of healthy
animals, and the farm inspector has expressed the decided opinion that the
tuberculosis in this division is no more developed than at the beginning of the
experiment. The testimony of many owners of large herds of cattle which have
long ago been injected is to the same effect. I will adduce statements from
several. A farm tenant whose cattle were injected 20 months previously, when 82
per cent of the grown animals reacted, wrote me recently as follows: "Only 2
cows from the division of 100 head had been sold as decidedly tuberculous. The
majority appeared afterwards, just as before, entirely healthy. The fat animals
which had been slaughtered had been pronounced healthy by the butchers."
Another farm tenant with a herd injected in 1894 had not been obliged to remove
a single animal from the tuberculosis division, numbering 70 head. A large farm
owner in Jutland stated in September that he had traced no undesirable result
from the injection. His herd of 350 had been injected in February and about 75
per cent reacted. Similar answers have been given by other owners and
veterinarians.</p>

<p>A veterinarian who had injected 600 animals, among them a herd of a large
farm, 18 months previously, expressed the belief that the injection had
produced in no single case an unusually rapid or vicious course of
tuberculosis. In spite of a demand made months ago, I have received thus far no
report from any veterinarian of an undesirable result.</p>

<p>On a large farm, on which before the injection tuberculosis had appeared in
a vicious form, the owner had the impression that the severe cases had
afterwards become more numerous. He had, however, not suffered severe losses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
and 8 months later the large reacting division by no means made a bad
impression. Finally, it is to be noticed that tuberculin has been employed on a
large scale in Denmark for years, and still the demand from farmers constantly
increases. This could certainly not be the case if the injections were
generally followed by bad results.</p>
</div>

<p>Paige said, after the tests of the herd of the Massachusetts Agricultural
College, that "its use is not followed by any ill effects of a serious or permanent
nature."</p>

<p>Lamson, of the New Hampshire College Agricultural Experiment Station, said:
"There is abundant testimony that its use is not in any way injurious to a
healthy animal."</p>

<p>Conn, who made a special study of the present attitude of European science
toward tuberculosis in cattle, reached the following conclusions:</p>

<p class="blockquot"></p>

<p>It has been, from the first, thought by some that the use of tuberculin
produces a direct injury upon the inoculated animals. This, however, is
undoubtedly a mistake, and there is no longer any belief anywhere on the part
of scientists that the injury thus produced is worthy of note. In the first
place, the idea that it may produce the disease in a perfectly healthy animal
by the inoculation is absolutely fallacious. The tuberculin does not contain
the tubercle bacillus, and it is absolutely certain that it is impossible to
produce a case of tuberculosis in an animal unless the tubercle bacilli are
present. The use of tuberculin, therefore, certainly can never produce the
disease in the inoculated animal.</p>

<p>It has been more widely believed, however, that the inoculation of an animal
with this material has a tendency to stimulate an incipient case of
tuberculosis. It has been thought that an animal with a very slight case of the
disease may, after inoculation, show a very rapid extension of this disease and
be speedily brought to a condition where it is beyond any use. The reasons
given for this have been the apparent activity of the tuberculosis infection in
animals that have been slaughtered shortly after inoculation. This has been
claimed, not only by agriculturists who have not understood the subject well,
but also by veterinarians and bacteriologists. But here, too, we must recognize
that the claim has been disproved, and that there is now a practical unanimity
of opinion on the part of all who are best calculated to judge that such an
injurious effect does not occur. Even those who have been most pronounced in
the claim that there is injury thus resulting from tuberculin have, little by
little, modified their claim, until at the present time they say either that
the injury which they formerly claimed does not occur or that the stimulus of
the disease is so slight that it should be absolutely neglected in view of the
great value which may arise from the use of tuberculin. Apart from two or three
who hold this very moderate opinion, all bacteriologists and veterinarians
unite in agreeing that there is no evidence for believing that any injury
results. In Denmark, especially, many hundreds of thousands of animals have
been inoculated, and the veterinarians say there is absolutely no reason in all
their experience for believing that the tuberculin inoculation is followed by
any injurious results.</p>

<p>In 1898 tuberculosis was found in the large Shorthorn herd belonging to W.
C. Edwards, of Canada, who with commendable promptness and public spirit had
his animals tested, and at once proceeded to separate the diseased from the
healthy animals. They were all finely bred animals, and of the very class which
we have been told are most susceptible to the injurious effects of tuberculin.
After <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
using this test regularly for two years, Mr. Edwards wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I have seen nothing to lead me to believe that the tuberculin test had any
injurious influence on the course of the disease. It is by no means our opinion
that the disease has been stimulated or aggravated by the application of the
tuberculin test. All animals that we have tested two or three times continue as
hale and hearty as they were previously, and not one animal in our herds has
broken down or failed in any way since we began testing.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Edwards, in December, 1901, verbally stated that his views as to the
harmlessness of tuberculin remained unchanged, and that he had not seen the
least ill effect in any of his cattle from its use.</p>

<p>Those who have had most experience with tuberculin have failed to observe
any injurious effects following its use upon healthy cattle. With tuberculous
cattle it produces a fever of short duration, and in the great majority of
cases all derangement of the system which it causes disappears within 48 hours
after the tuberculin is administered. There appear to have been a very few
cases in which the disease was aggravated, and a greater number in which it was
benefited by the injection of tuberculin. The cases of abortion following the
tuberculin test have not been numerous, even when cows were tested within a few
weeks of the normal time of calving. The few cases of this kind which have
occurred may be explained by the fact that abortion in cattle is a very common
occurrence, and that it would inevitably happen sometimes after the tuberculin
test as a mere coincidence and without any relation between the test and the
loss of the calf. The cases of abortion which have been cited appear to be no
more numerous than might be expected to have occurred among the same number of
cattle within the same period if the test had not been applied.</p>

<p>At the present time there is ample evidence to show that tuberculin is the
most reliable means of detecting tuberculosis in the living animal and that its
use is not attended by any harmful aftereffects.</p>

<p>An act of Congress was approved July 24, 1919, for the purpose of
controlling and eradicating tuberculosis of animals. The official means of
detecting tuberculosis in the living animal is the tuberculin test, which may
be applied by three different methods&mdash;the subcutaneous, the intradermic,
and the ophthalmic. It is not necessary to discuss here the details of these
three methods, which are made use of in the work of eradication of
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The plan adopted by the State and Federal authorities in eradication of the
disease is known as "The Accredited-Herd Plan." Under this plan herds are
tested under State and Federal supervision, the diseased animals are appraised,
removed, and slaughtered under Federal inspection. Retests are then made after
definite periods of time until two successive tests show all the animals to
be free from the disease. At this time the herd owner is given a certificate of
an accredited herd.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Details concerning the accredited-herd plan may be obtained by applying to
the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Washington, D. C.</p>

<h4>THE TUBERCULIN TESTS.</h4>

<p>Testing animals with tuberculin is the process of introducing tuberculin
into the animal and interpreting results according to well-known standards.</p>

<p>From the investigations and observations that have been mentioned, it may be
safely concluded&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the tuberculin test is a wonderfully accurate method of determining
whether an animal is affected with tuberculosis.</p>

<p>2. That by its use the animals diseased with tuberculosis may be detected
and removed from the herd, thereby eradicating the disease.</p>

<p>3. That it has no injurious effect upon healthy cattle.</p>

<p>4. That the comparatively small number of cattle which have aborted,
suffered in health, or fallen off in condition after the test were either
diseased before it was made or were affected by some cause other than the
tuberculin.</p>

<h5>THE SUBCUTANEOUS TEST (UNDER THE SKIN).</h5>

<p>The most frequently used method of testing is the subcutaneous test, which
consists in injecting the proper quantity of tuberculin underneath the skin
into the subcutaneous tissue. If an animal is tuberculous, the action of the
tuberculin causes a fever, which is indicated by a rise in temperature. This
rise, under ordinary conditions, may occur any time between the eighth and
twentieth hours after the tuberculin is injected, but in some cases it is
desirable to measure the temperature before the eighth hour and continue to the
twenty-fourth hour or longer.</p>

<p>The temperatures are measured at least 3 times in advance of the injection,
at 2-hour intervals, to learn whether the animal is in proper condition to
receive the test. The temperatures after injection are taken every 2 hours
until the test is completed. The proper interpretation of the temperatures is
made by the person applying the test, and a careful observance of any clinical
changes is always important in determining the result. It can not be set forth
too strongly that the test, including the two following methods, should be
attempted only by those who are properly qualified to do the work.</p>

<h5>THE INTRADERMIC TEST (INTO THE SKIN).</h5>

<p>The intradermic test for detecting tuberculosis is used to a considerable
extent, especially in area work and on range cattle not easily controlled. When
made by those who have become skilled in its application, it is very accurate.
In this test the tuberculin is injected between the layers of the skin, only a
few drops being used, and it is usually applied in the region at the base of
the tail, where the skin is soft and nearly hairless. The intradermic test is
satisfactory also for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in swine and, when so used,
the tuberculin is applied into the skin of the ear near its base.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The reaction from the intradermic test consists of a swelling at the point
of injection and is observed from 72 to 150 hours after the injection. The
character of the swelling varies, and a proper diagnosis of tuberculosis by
this test can be made only by an experienced person.</p>

<h5>THE OPHTHALMIC TEST (INTO THE EYE).</h5>

<p>Still another method, known as the ophthalmic test, is used quite frequently
and has been found to be of considerable value in what is known as "check"
testing; that is, it is used in connection with either of the previously
described methods. Sometimes a tuberculous animal that fails to react to those
tests shows evidence of the disease upon the application of the ophthalmic
test. The ophthalmic tuberculin is placed in one eye and the other eye is used
as a check. A reaction is indicated by a characteristic discharge from the eye
receiving the treatment, which may occur in from 3 to 10 hours after the
application or even later. Some swelling and inflammation of the eye and lids
are often noted.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS.</h4>

<p>Treatment of the disease is not seriously considered by any authorities at
the present time.</p>

<p>The measures to be adopted to prevent the spreading of the disease must take
into consideration not only the tubercle bacillus, but likewise all those
circumstances that make cattle more susceptible to the disease, and which have
already been dwelt upon. It would be useless to repeat here all that has been
said above on the transmission of tubercle bacilli from one animal to another,
and on the dangers of certain debilitating influences. A careful study of these
influences will show how tuberculosis may, at least in some cases, be
prevented. Great care should be bestowed upon the breeding, the surroundings,
and the feed of the animal, so that the latter may be put into a condition to
resist infection even when exposed to it. A tuberculin test should be applied
to all strange cattle before they are introduced into the herd, and those which
show a reaction should be refused.</p>

<p>A rigid exclusion of tuberculous animals is all that is necessary to prevent
the appearance of the disease, provided cattle are not infected by consumptive
persons and animals. The transmission of the disease from man to cattle is
probably not frequent, but is regarded as a possible source of infection.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis in cattle must also be considered as bearing upon tuberculosis
of other domesticated animals, particularly hogs. In Europe and the United
States this disease is not uncommon among hogs, and appears to be on the
increase. The reason for its existence may be looked for in the feeding of pigs
with skim milk, buttermilk, and whey from creameries, with the offal of the
abattoirs, with the household refuse generally, and behind tuberculous cattle.
If tuber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
culosis is common among cattle, it is likely to be transmitted to hogs
kept in this way.</p>

<p>The carcasses of animals which have died of tuberculosis should be buried
deeply so that they can not be eaten by other animals. This is likewise true of
all organs or tissues of slaughtered animals containing tubercles. These should
never be fed to other animals, such as hogs, dogs, and cats, and should either
be destroyed by fire or deeply buried.</p>

<p>When any of the animals in a herd of cattle show evident symptoms of
tuberculosis, or when the tuberculin test proves that they are affected with
this disease, the best method of procedure in most cases is to have the
affected animals slaughtered and the stables disinfected. A large proportion of
the animals which are slightly affected yield carcasses which are perfectly
wholesome and fit for human food, but in all such cases there should be an
inspection by an expert at the time of slaughter to determine which carcasses
may be used and which should be destroyed.</p>

<p>The disinfection of stables may be accomplished by thoroughly cleaning them,
scrubbing the floors with hot water, brushing down all loose dust from the
walls, and tearing off all woodwork which is partly decayed. Then the whole
interior of the stable should be covered with a good coat of limewash
containing 1 part of formalin (which is a 40 per cent watery solution of
formaldehyde) to 30 parts of the lime wash, or 4 ounces of formalin to each
gallon of lime wash.</p>

<p>Similar precautions should be observed in removing the manure of the
infected herd from the barnyard and other places accessible to cattle, since it
is known that tuberculous cattle frequently eliminate large numbers of tubercle
bacilli through the feces. The ground under the manure pile should then be
disinfected, either by the above-mentioned formalin solution or by unslaked
lime thickly sprinkled over the soil.</p>

<p>If all the animals which react are destroyed and the stables disinfected in
this manner, the herd should remain free from the disease unless other affected
animals are added to it. The introduction of the disease in this manner may be
avoided by requiring a tuberculin test of all new animals admitted on the
premises.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is a fact that tuberculous animals which have been tested
several times may become so accustomed to tuberculin that they will no longer
react; consequently it is always advisable to purchase cattle from some one who
is known to be reliable, as otherwise animals of this kind may be treated with
tuberculin for the purpose of hiding the disease.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the case of very valuable purebred animals and under exceptional
circumstances it may be more advantageous to retain the reacting animals which
are in good condition in order to breed from them and in that manner avoid the
excessive loss which would follow from their immediate slaughter. This may be
done if proper precautions are adopted.</p>

<p>The disposal of reactors depends upon the State laws and live-stock
regulations of the State in which the herd belongs. If this policy is followed
it should be attempted only after careful study of the plan known as the Bang
method of controlling tuberculosis. The live-stock officials of the State
should be frequently consulted and their advice followed; otherwise failure
will surely ensue. The plan necessitates considerable trouble and is not
recommended except under the circumstances mentioned.</p>

<h4>BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH.</h4>

<p>The increasing amount of evidence pointing to the identity of human and
animal tuberculosis, combined with the extraordinary mortality of human beings
from this disease, often amounting to 10 to 14 per cent, has raised the
question in all civilized countries as to how far animal, and especially
bovine, tuberculosis is to blame for this high mortality. The medical and
veterinary professions have approached this problem with equal zeal, and much
has come to light within recent years which enables us to come to some
conclusion. If this disease is transmitted from animals to man, how does
the transmission take place? As comparatively few people come in direct contact
with tuberculous cattle, it must be either through the meat, the milk, the
butter, the cheese, or through all these products that the virus enters the
human body. The question has thus narrowed itself down to the food products
furnished by cattle.</p>

<p>It has become a very urgent question, especially in the poorer countries of
Europe, whether all flesh from tuberculous animals is unfit for human food. It
is argued there that if it can be shown that in the majority of cases of
tuberculosis the bones and the muscular system are free from infection, there
is no reason why the meat should not be put on sale under certain restrictions.
The question may be resolved into two divisions: (1) How frequently does the
disease invade those parts of the body which are used as food? (2) When the
disease process is manifestly restricted to the internal organs, do tubercle
bacilli circulate in the blood and lymph and can they be detected in the
muscular tissue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
(1) Disease of the bones is not unknown, although very rare. According to
Walley, it appears chiefly in the spongy bones of the head and backbone and in
the long bones of the limbs. Occasionally the ends of the bones, where they are
covered by the synovial membrane of the joints, are dotted with tubercles. The
muscular system itself is very rarely the seat of tuberculous deposits,
although the lymphatic glands lying near and among the muscles may be not
infrequently diseased.</p>

<p>(2) Whether tubercle bacilli are found in muscle juice independent of any
tuberculous deposits is a question which must be approached experimentally.
There is on record a great variety of opinions on this matter, some authorities
considering all flesh from tuberculous animals unfit for food, while others
hold a contrary view. Experiments have shown that in rare cases the flesh of
tuberculous cattle contains a small number of tubercle bacilli. In Germany the
flesh of animals in which the disease is just beginning, or in which it is
restricted to one or more related organs, is not rejected. When, however, the
disease has affected the muscles or bones, or lymphatic glands situated on or
between them, the flesh is condemned as unfit and dangerous. Animals are also
rejected in which it is evident, from the general distribution of tubercles
throughout the various organs, that the bacilli have been distributed by the
blood and may have been carried into the muscular system (generalized
tuberculosis).</p>

<p>Concerning the infectious nature of milk secreted by tuberculous cows,
authorities have universally agreed that when the udder itself is in the
slightest degree involved the milk possesses infectious properties, and is
therefore dangerous. Tubercle bacilli in large numbers have been found in the
milk and the udder under such circumstances. Unlike other affections of the
udder, tuberculosis of this organ does not at once change the appearance and
the quality of the milk secreted. Bang states that for at least a month after
the disease has appeared the milk is normal in appearance and may be consumed
and sold without arousing the suspicion of the owner. Considerable danger is,
therefore, involved in this disease, and the necessity for the careful
inspection of dairy cows seems more urgent than ever.</p>

<p>Authorities are, however, not fully agreed as to whether the milk from
tuberculous cows in which the udder is apparently not invaded by the disease
should be considered dangerous or not. Some incline to the belief that the milk
secreted by healthy udders is never infectious, even when the lungs or other
organs are affected; that, in other words, the tubercle bacilli are rarely, if
ever, separated from the lesions which they produce, and that the udder itself
must be diseased before tubercle bacilli can appear in the milk. Experiments
made <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
with the milk of tuberculous cows in which there were no indications of
udder disease do not bear out this theory, since tubercle bacilli have been
found in their milk. Some authorities still believe that the udder is diseased
when the milk is infected, but that the disease escapes observation. However
this may be, the fact that the udder may be diseased and the disease not
recognizable simply casts suspicion upon all milk from tuberculous animals. We
know that the milk of tuberculous cattle may or may not contain tubercle
bacilli when the udder is apparently free from disease, but we have no rapid
method of determining whether in any given case the milk contains tubercle
bacilli or not. Moreover, the bacilli may be absent at one time and present at
another in milk from the same cow. When we consider, therefore, the extent of
tuberculosis and the hidden character of the disease, a certain degree of
suspicion rests upon all milk from untested cattle. Fortunately, tubercle
bacilli are readily destroyed by the temperature of boiling water, and hence
both meat and milk are made safe, the former by the various processes of
cooking, the latter by boiling for a few moments. It is incumbent upon all
communities to have dairy cows examined and tested with tuberculin. If disease
is detected, the affected animal should be killed at once or else all
opportunity for the sale of such milk removed by appropriate measures. Where
milk or cream is sold to the trade in large towns or cities pasteurization
should be required as an additional safeguard.</p>

<p>Recently there has been much discussion of the question as to whether human
and animal tuberculosis are identical diseases and as to the possibility of the
tuberculosis of animals being transmitted to man or that of man being
transmitted to animals.</p>

<p>The fact that tuberculous material from human subjects often failed to
produce serious disease in cattle was observed by a number of the earlier
investigators who experimented with such virus. It was the experiments and
comparative studies of Theobald Smith, however, which attracted special
attention to the difference in virulence shown by tubercle bacilli from human
and bovine sources when inoculated upon cattle. Smith mentioned also certain
morphological and cultural differences in bacilli from these two sources, and
in the location and histology of the lesions in cattle produced by such
bacilli. He did not conclude, however, that bovine bacilli could not produce
disease in the human subject, but said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It seems to me that, accepting the clinical evidence on hand, bovine
tuberculosis may be transmitted to children when the body is overpowered by
large numbers of bacilli, as in udder tuberculosis, or when certain unknown
favorable conditions exist.</p>
</div>

<p>Koch, however, in his address at the British Congress on Tuberculosis, went
far beyond this and maintained that "human tubercu<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>losis differs from bovine and
can not be transmitted to cattle." As to the susceptibility of man to bovine
tuberculosis, he said it was not yet absolutely decided, but one was
"nevertheless already at liberty to say that, if such a susceptibility really
exists, the infection of human beings is but a very rare occurrence." He
emphasizes this view in the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I should estimate the extent of infection by the milk and flesh of
tubercular cattle and the butter made of their milk as hardly greater than that
of hereditary transmission, and I therefore do not deem it advisable to take
any measures against it.</p>
</div>

<p>This conclusion was so radically different from the views of most
experimenters and so out of harmony with facts which had apparently been
demonstrated by others that it at once aroused opposition in the congress,
followed by the adoption of dissenting resolutions, and led to numerous
investigations in various countries. Koch's conclusions were based upon his
failure to produce tuberculosis in cattle and other animals by inoculating them
with tuberculous material of human origin and his success in causing
progressive and fatal tuberculosis in the same kinds of animals when inoculated
with tuberculous material of bovine origin. With such positiveness did he hold
to the constant and specific difference between the human and bovine bacillus
that he promulgated an experimental method of discriminating between them.
Speaking of the etiology of intestinal tuberculosis in man, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Hitherto nobody could decide with certainty in such a case whether the
tuberculosis of the intestine was of human or of animal origin. Now we can
diagnose them. All that is necessary is to cultivate in pure culture the
tubercle bacilli found in the tubercular material, and to ascertain whether
they belong to bovine tuberculosis by inoculating cattle with them. For this
purpose I recommend subcutaneous injection, which yields quite specially
characteristic and convincing results.</p>
</div>

<p>These important and comprehensive conclusions followed from a comparatively
few experiments upon animals, and apparently no effort had been made to learn
to what extent human tubercle bacilli may differ in their virulence for cattle
or what grades of virulence there might be among bacilli of bovine origin.
Vagedes had already shown that bacilli were sometimes present in human lesions
which were as virulent as bovine bacilli, but his work was wholly ignored by
Koch.</p>

<p>A considerable number of investigators, including Chauveau, Vagedes,
Ravenel, De Schweinitz, Mohler, De Jong, DelÃ©pine, Orth, StenstrÃ¶m, Fibiger and
Jensen, Max Wolff, Nocard, Arloing, Behring, Dean and Todd, Hamilton and Young,
the German Tuberculosis Commission, and Theobald Smith, have found tubercle
bacilli in the bodies of human beings who died of tuberculosis which proved to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
have about the same virulence for cattle as had the bacilli from bovine animals
affected by the disease.</p>

<p>Kossel, in a preliminary report, stated that the German commission had
tested 7 cultures of tuberculosis from cattle and hogs&mdash;4 from cattle and
3 from hogs. Two proved acutely fatal in cattle after eight to nine weeks; 4
likewise produced a generalized tuberculosis, but which certainly had a more
chronic course, while 1 of the cultures caused only an infiltration at the
point of inoculation, with some caseous foci in the adjoining prescapular gland
and in one of the mediastinal glands, and there was lacking the spreading of
the tuberculosis over the entire body which they were accustomed to see after
the injection of cultures of bovine tuberculosis. "Hence," says Kossel, "among
bovine tuberculosis bacilli there can also occur differences with regard to the
virulence."</p>

<p>The German commission also tested 39 different freshly made cultures from
tuberculous disease in man. Nineteen did not produce the slightest symptoms in
cattle; with 9 others the cattle exhibited after four months very minute foci
in the prescapular glands, which were mostly encapsuled and showed no
inclination to progress; with 7 other cases there was somewhat more marked
disease of the prescapular glands, but it did not go so far as a material
spreading of the process to the adjoining glands. There were 4 cultures,
however, which were more virulent and caused generalized tuberculosis in the
cattle inoculated with them.</p>

<p>It would appear, therefore, that hereafter everyone must admit that it is
impossible always to tell the source of a culture of the tubercle bacillus by
its effect when it is inoculated upon cattle. One of the bovine cultures failed
to produce generalized tuberculosis in cattle, and some of the human cultures
did produce it in such animals. Moreover, while some of the human cultures
caused no disease at all, others led to the development of minute foci in the
prescapular glands, and still others to somewhat more marked disease of the
glands. There were, consequently, four degrees of virulence noted in these 39
cultures of bacilli from human sources and three degrees of virulence in the 7
cultures from animal.</p>

<p>Now, if we accept the views of Koch as to the specific difference between
human and bovine tubercle bacilli, and that the human bacilli produce only
localized lesions in cattle, while bovine bacilli produce generalized lesions
in them, must we not conclude that the one non-virulent bovine culture was in
reality of human origin, and that the animal from which it was obtained had
been infected from man? This is a logical deduction, but reverses the dictum
laid down at London that human tuberculosis is not transmissible to cattle.
Again, how are we to explain the human cultures of medium virulence? Are they
human bacilli which, for some unknown reason, are <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>increasing in virulence and
approaching the activity of the bovine bacillus, or are they really bovine
bacilli which have multiplied in the human body until their virulence has
become attenuated? In whatever manner these questions are decided it would seem
that the findings of the German commission, instead of supporting Koch's views
that we can decide with certainty by the inoculation of cattle as to the source
of any given bacillus, really show that this method of diagnosis is extremely
uncertain in the present condition of our knowledge.</p>

<p>It is definitely admitted that 4 of the human cultures caused generalized
tuberculosis in cattle; Kossel suggest, however, that it may be possible that
the bacilli in cases of human tuberculosis under certain circumstances can
likewise attain a very high pathogenic activity for cattle without being for
that reason bovine bacilli. Undoubtedly the German commission is confronting
the two horns of a dilemma, either one of which is fatal to the views of Koch
as stated with such positiveness at London. If we accept this suggestion thrown
out by Kossel, we must conclude that Koch was wrong in his claim that human
tuberculosis can not be transmitted to cattle, and thus with one blow we
destroy the entire experimental support which he had for his argument before
the British Congress on Tuberculosis. If, on the other hand, we accept the
conclusion which follows from the principle laid down by Koch for the
discrimination between human and bovine bacilli, and which appears to be favored by
Kossel, we must admit that bovine tuberculosis is an extremely important factor
in the etiology of human tuberculosis. Of the 39 cases of human tuberculosis
tested, 4, or more than 10 per cent, were virulent for cattle and would be
classified as of bovine origin; however, these 4 cases, were all found among
the 16 cases of tuberculosis in children which the commission investigated;
hence it is plain that 25 per cent of the cases tested of tuberculosis in
children would by Koch's method be classified as of bovine origin.</p>

<p>In the Bureau of Animal Industry two distinct lines of experiments have been
carried on, in order that one might serve as a check against the other. There
has been, however, no discrepancy in the results. De Schweinitz, in the
Biochemic Division, Bureau of Animal Industry, isolated 9 cultures from human
tuberculosis. Two were derived from human sputum, 3 from cases of generalized
tuberculosis in adults, and 4 from cases of generalized tuberculosis in
children. By comparing these cultures with a newly isolated virulent culture of
bovine tuberculosis, there were found among them 2 cultures from children which
were identical in their cultural and morphological characters with the bovine
bacillus. These cultures also killed rabbits and guinea pigs in as short a time
as did the bovine bacillus. Hogs which were inoculated subcutane<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>ously with these 2 cultures
from children died of generalized tuberculosis. Two calves weighing more than
300 pounds each were inoculated subcutaneously with these virulent human
cultures, and as a result developed generalized tuberculosis. A yearling
heifer inoculated with 1 of the cultures showed generalized tuberculosis
when killed three months after inoculation. Both the cattle and the hogs
had been tested with tuberculin and found to be free from tuberculosis
before the inoculations were made. It is important to observe in this
connection that 2 out of 4, or 50 per cent, of the cultures obtained from
cases of generalized tuberculosis in children proved virulent for cattle.</p>

<p>Mohler, working in the Pathological Division, Bureau of Animal Industry,
obtained 3 very virulent cultures of tubercle bacilli from the human subject. A
goat inoculated subcutaneously with 1 of these cultures died in 37 days with
miliary tuberculosis of the lungs involving the axillary and prescapular
glands. This bacillus was obtained from the mesenteric gland of a boy. Of still
greater interest is a bacillus isolated by Mohler from human sputum. A goat
inoculated subcutaneously with a culture of this germ died in 95 days of
pulmonary tuberculosis. A cat inoculated in the same manner died in 23 days of
generalized tuberculosis. A rabbit similarly inoculated died in 59 days of
pulmonary tuberculosis. Another rabbit inoculated with a bovine culture for
comparison lived 10 days longer than the one inoculated with this sputum germ.
Mohler also inoculated subcutaneously a 1-year-old heifer with a culture
derived from the tuberculosis mesenteric gland of a boy 4 years of age. This
culture was always refractory in its growth under artificial conditions, and
the bacilli were short, stubby rods, corresponding in appearance to the bovine
type. At the autopsy, held 127 days after the inoculation, the general
condition was seen to be poor and unthrifty, and large, hard tumors were found
at the points of inoculation. On the right side the swelling measured 3&frac12; by
5 inches, and the corresponding lymph gland was 2&frac34; inches long by 1&frac34;
inches in diameter. This gland contained numerous calcareous foci; one at the
apex was an inch in diameter. The lesions on the left shoulder of the animal
were very similar to those found on the right side, but the dimensions of the
tumor were slightly less. The lungs presented an irregular mass of tuberculous
nodules, and 7 or 8 grapelike nodules were seen on the parietal pleura.
Bronchial and mediastinal lymph glands contained numerous tuberculous foci, and
the pericardium, peritoneum, spleen, and liver also were affected.</p>

<p>In order to throw some light, if possible, upon the morphological constancy
of the different types of tubercle bacilli, Mohler made comparative studies of
bacilli from various sources, and which had been passed through various species
of animals, by making the cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436"
id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>tures upon dog serum after the method described by
Theobald Smith. Some important results have been obtained. One culture of human
bacilli which had morphological and cultural peculiarities similar to those of
the bovine bacillus, and which produced only local lesions in cattle, was
passed through a series of five cats. It was then found to be completely
changed in its morphological characters, the rods being elongated, slender,
more or less beaded, and entirely of the human type. Far from decreasing in
virulence, however, as might be expected from its morphological appearance,
this bacillus had so increased in its pathogenic activity that it produced
generalized tuberculosis in a cow. This cow was inoculated subcutaneously in
front of each shoulder with 2 cubic centimeters of a salt-solution emulsion of
the tuberculous omentum of the last cat of the series. The cow rapidly lost
flesh, had a temperature of 104Â° F., with the point of inoculation and adjacent
glands greatly swollen. The autopsy revealed generalized tuberculosis,
involving the lungs, mediastinal glands, spleen, liver, and kidneys. Tubercle
bacilli of the bovine type obtained from the mesenteric glands of a sheep, hog,
and cow were similarly transformed in their morphological appearance after
being passed through a series of cats and recovered on dog serum. These bacilli
also increased in virulence, as the last cat in the series invariably succumbed
in a shorter time than the first of the series.</p>

<p>These experiments and observations indicate that the types of tubercle
bacilli are very inconstant, and that under suitable conditions they readily
change both in morphology and in virulence. A similar conclusion was reached by
other investigators in working with the avian and porcine types of tubercle
bacilli several years ago, and was reasonably to have been expected with the
human and bovine types.</p>

<p>Later investigations made by Park and Krumweide, of the Research Laboratory
of New York City, Novick, Richard M. Smith, Ravenel, Rosenau, Chung Yik Wang,
and others tend to show the incidence of bovine infection in the human family.
Chung Yik Wang stated in 1917 that studies of 281 cases of various clinical
forms of tuberculosis in Edinburgh, Scotland, resulted in the isolation of the
bovine tubercle bacilli in 78.4 per cent of cases under the age of 5 years, in
70.3 per cent between the ages of 5 and 16, and in 7.8 per cent over the age of
16. This investigator states that from the prophylactic point of view any
measure resorted to in combating the disease should be directed not only
against the human spread of infection, but also, more particularly in
children's cases, against the bovine source of infection.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Ravenel, in summarizing the work of Drs. Park and Krumweide, as well as
others throughout the world, gives the following results:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Of 63 children dying of tuberculosis at the babies' hospital 59 cases proved
to be human infection and 4 bovine, a percentage of 6-1/3.</p>

<p>Of 9 children dying of tuberculosis at the foundling hospital 4 proved to
have derived their infection from human sources and 5 from bovine, a percentage
of 55.</p>

<p>Of a total of 88 children under 5 years of age who died of tuberculosis 77
proved to have derived their infection from human sources and 11 from bovine, a
percentage of 12&frac12;.</p>
</div>

<p>Combining the cases studied in New York with those of other observers in
different parts of this country and Europe, the following results are
obtained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Adults, 787 cases&mdash;777 human and 10 bovine infection.</p>

<p>Children, 5 to 16 years, 153 cases&mdash;117 human and 36 bovine
infection.</p>

<p>Children under 5 years, 280 cases&mdash;215 human and 65 bovine
infection.</p>
</div>

<p>The figures of the foundling hospital show the real danger of unprotected
cows' milk.</p>

<p>The conclusion from these studies is inevitable, namely, that in children,
in addition to the large number of deaths which occur from bovine infection,
there are many cases of infection resulting in deformities, necessitating
operations more or less severe in character and which frequently leave the
patient disfigured permanently.</p>

<p>It must be plain to all, from these recent developments, that too much has
been made of the slight differences in cultural characteristics, in morphology,
and in virulence which have been observed in some cases in comparing the human
and the bovine bacilli. The observations were interesting, and it was important
that they be followed up until their significance was made entirely clear, but
it was an almost unpardonable error, from a sanitary point of view, to
promulgate sweeping generalizations calculated to arrest and abolish important
measures for preventing human tuberculosis before the soundness of these
generalizations had been established by a thorough course of experimentation.</p>

<p>When Koch said in the British Congress on Tuberculosis that he should
estimate the extent of infection by the milk and flesh of tuberculous cattle
and the butter made of their milk as hardly greater than that of hereditary
transmission, and that he therefore did not deem it advisable to take any
measures against it, he went far beyond what was justified by any experiments
or observations which he reported, and he did a great deal of harm, which will
be manifested for years to come, to those who endeavor to guard the human race
from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a>
</span>dangers of animal tuberculosis. The researches which have been alluded
to make these dangers more definite and certain than they have appeared before,
and sanitarians should therefore most earnestly endeavor to counteract the
erroneous and harmful impression which was made by Koch's address at London
and his subsequent address at the International Conference on Tuberculosis at
Berlin.</p>

<h4>VACCINIA OR COWPOX.</h4>

<p>Variola of cattle, more correctly vaccinia, is a contagious disease of
cattle which manifests its presence through an elevation of temperature, a
shrinkage in milk production, and by the appearance of characteristic, pustular
eruptions, especially upon the teats and udders of dairy cows. Although this is
a contagious disease, strictly speaking, it is so universally harmless and
benign in its course that it is robbed of the terrors which usually accompany
all spreading diseases, and is allowed to enter a herd of cattle, run its
course, and disappear without exciting any particular notice.</p>

<p>The contagion of cowpox does not travel through the air from animal to
animal, but is transfused only by actual contact of the contagious principle
with the skin of some susceptible animal. It may be carried in this manner, not
alone from cattle to cattle, but horses, sheep, goats, and man may readily
contract the disease whenever suitable conditions attend their inoculation.</p>

<p>An identical disease frequently appears upon horses, attacking their heels,
and thence extending upward along the leg, producing, as it progresses,
inflammation and swelling of the skin, followed later by pustules, which soon
rupture, discharging a sticky, disagreeable secretion. Other parts of the body
are frequently affected in like manner, especially in the region of the head,
where the eruptions may appear upon lips and nostrils, or upon the mucous
surfaces of the nasal cavities, mouth, or eyes.</p>

<p>Variola of the horse is readily transmitted to cattle, if both are cared for
by the same attendant, and, conversely, variola of cattle may be carried from
the cow to the horse on the hands of a person who has been milking a cow
affected with the disease.</p>

<p>The method of vaccination with material derived from the eruptions of cowpox
as a safeguard against the ravages of smallpox in members of the human family
is well known. The immunity which such vaccination confers upon the human
subject has led many writers to assert that cowpox is simply a modified form of
smallpox, whose harmless attack upon the human system is owing to a certain
attenuation derived during its passages through the system of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>cow or horse.
The results of numerous experiments which have been carried out for the purpose
of determining the relationship existing between variola of the human and
bovine families seem to show, however, that although possessing many similar
characteristics, they are nevertheless distinct, and that in spite of repeated
inoculations from cattle to man, and vice versa, no transformation in the real
character of the disease ever takes place.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The disease appears in four to seven days after natural
infection, or may evince itself in two or three days as the result of
artificial inoculation. Young milch cows are most susceptible to an attack, but
older cows, bulls, or young cattle are by no means immune. The attack causes a
slight rise in temperature, which is soon followed by the appearance of
reddened, inflamed areas, principally upon the teats and udder, and at times on
the abdominal skin or the skin of the inner surface of the thighs. In a few
cases the skin of the throat and jaws has been found similarly involved. If the
affected parts are examined on the second day after the establishment of the
inflammation numerous pale-red nodules will be found, which gradually expand
until, within a few days, they reach a diameter of one-half inch or even
larger. At this period the tops of the nodules become transformed into vesicles
which are depressed in the center and contain a pale, serous fluid. They
usually reach their maturity by the tenth day of the course of the disease and
are then the size of a bean. From this time the contents of the vesicles become
purulent, which requires about three days, when the typical pox pustule is
present, consisting of a swelling with broad, reddened base, within which is an
elevated, conical abscess varying from the size of a pea to that of a
hazelnut.</p>

<p>The course of the disease after the full maturity of the pustule is rapid if
outside interference has not caused a premature rupture of the small abscess at
the apex of the swelling. The pustules gradually become darker colored and
drier until nothing remains but a thick scab, which at last falls off, leaving
only a slight, whitish scar behind. The total duration of the disease covers
some 20 days in each animal, and owing to the slow spread of the infection from
animal to animal, many weeks may elapse before a stable can be fully freed from
it. The fallen scabs and crusts may retain their contagious properties for
several days when mixed with litter and bedding upon the floor of the stable, and
at any time during this period they are capable of producing new outbreaks
should fresh cattle be brought into the stalls and thus come into actual
contact with them. Again, the pustules may appear, one after another, on a
single animal, in which case the duration of the disease is materially
lengthened.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In herds of cattle that regularly receive careful handling,
no special treatment will be found necessary beyond the appli<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>cation of softening and
disinfecting agents to such vesicles upon the teats as may have become ruptured
by the hands of the milker. Carbolized vaseline or iodoform ointment will be
found well suited to this work. In more persistent cases it may be found
desirable to use a milking tube in order to prevent the repeated opening of the
pustules during the operation of milking. Washing the sores twice daily with
a weak solution of zinc chlorid (2&frac12; per cent solution) has been found to
assist in checking the inflammation and to cleanse and heal the parts by its
germicidal action. When the udder is hard, swollen, and painful, support it
by a bandage and foment frequently with hot water. If calves are allowed to
suckle the cows the pustules become confluent, and the ulcerations may extend
up into the teat, causing garget and ruining the whole quarter of the udder.</p>

<p>As young cows are most susceptible to variola, the milker must exercise
constant patience with these affected animals so long as their teats or udders
are sore and tender, else the patient may contract vicious habits while
resisting painful handling. The flow of milk is usually lessened as soon as the
fever becomes established, but is again normal with the return of perfect
health.</p>

<p>The practice of thorough cleanliness in handling or milking affected cattle
may, in many instances, prevent the dissemination of the trouble among the
healthy portion of the herd, but even the greatest care may prove insufficient
to check the spread until it has attacked each animal of the herd in turn.</p>

<h4>ACTINOMYCOSIS (LUMPY JAW)</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XXXIX">Pls.&nbsp;XXXIX</a>-<a href="#PLATE_XLI">XLI</a>.]</h5>

<p>Actinomycosis, also known as lumpy jaw, big jaw, wooden tongue, etc., is a
chronic infectious disease characterized by the formation of peculiar tumors in
various regions of the body, more particularly the head, and is due to the
specific action of a certain fungus-like germ (actinomyces). This fungus is an
organism which occurs in the tissues in the form of rosettes, and it has
therefore been termed the "ray fungus." The disease is not directly transmitted
from one animal to another, but it seems apparent that the fungus is conveyed
into the tissues by various feedstuffs through slight wounds of the mucous
membrane of the mouth, decayed teeth, or during the shedding of milk teeth. The
ray fungus is found in nature vegetated on grasses, on the awns of barley, the
spears of oats, and on other grains. Quantities of the fungi have been found
between the vegetable fibers of barley which had penetrated the gums of cattle
and on the awns of grain embedded in the tongues of cows.</p>

<p>Although actinomycotic tumors on cattle had been the object of study for
many years, it was not until 1877 that the constant presence of actinomyces was
pointed out by Bollinger, of Munich, and since <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>that time considered the cause.
This fungus was observed in these tumors as early as 1860 by Rivolta, and by
others subsequently, without having been suspected as causing them.</p>

<p>Since Bollinger's publication much work has been done, many observations
made, and many hitherto obscure disease processes brought into relation with
this fungus. Furthermore, a similar disease in man was first definitely shown
to be associated with the same fungus in 1878 by Israel, and in the following
year Ponfick pointed out that the disease described by Bollinger in animals and
that found by Israel in man were due to the same cause; that is, that the fungi
described by these observers were one and the same.</p>

<p>The tumors and abscesses wherever they may be are all found to be the same
in origin by the presence of the actinomyces fungus. When they are incised, a
very close scrutiny with the naked eye, or, at most, a hand lens, will reveal
the presence of minute grains which vary from a pale-yellow to a sulphur-yellow
color. They may be very abundant or so few as to be overlooked. They are
embedded in the soft tissue composing the tumor or in the pus of the abscess.
With a needle they are easily lifted out from the tissue, and then they appear
as roundish masses about one-half millimeter (1/50 inch) in diameter. To anyone
familiar with the use of a microscope the recognition of these grains or
particles without any previous preparation is a comparatively easy task.</p>

<p>When examined in the fresh condition under a microscope magnifying up to 250
diameters the general structure is made out without much difficulty. These
grains consist of collections of minute, roundish masses. Their outer surface
is made up of club-shaped bodies all radiating from the center of the mass (see
<a href="#PLATE_XXXIX">Pl. XXXIX</a>, fig. 2), somewhat like a rosette. If the
fungus is crushed, the interior is found made up of bundles of very fine
filaments, which are probably continuous into the club-shaped bodies. The
addition of a dilute solution of caustic soda or potash greatly aids the
examination, as it removes the layer of cells adhering to the fungus, which
obscures the structure. Now and then these grains are found to be in a
calcified condition. The exterior is incrusted in lime salts, which are
dissolved by adding some weak dilute acid, like acetic acid. Only by this
procedure can the fungus be definitely recognized when in a mummified
condition.</p>

<p>These are the bodies whose presence causes sufficient irritation in the
tissues into which they find their way to set up inflammatory growths. These
growths increase as the fungus continues to multiply until they reach enormous
dimensions, if the affected animal is permitted to live long enough. The true
nature of this parasite is not yet definitely settled, although many excellent
observers have occupied themselves with it. According to earlier observers, it
is a true <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a>
</span>fungus. Later ones are inclined to place it among the higher
bacteria. Present knowledge concerning the actinomyces growth indicates that it
should be classified with the higher bacteria or trichomycetes.</p>

<p>Whatever the situation of the disease caused by actinomyces may be, its
nature is fundamentally the same and peculiar to the fungus. The pathological
details which make this statement clear can not be entered upon in this place,
nor would they be of any practical value to the farmer. We will simply dwell
upon a few obvious characters.</p>

<p>The consistency of the tumor varies in different situations according to the
quantity of fibrous or connective tissue present. When very little of this is
present the tumor is of a very soft consistency. As the quantity of connective
tissue is increased the tumor is firmer and of a more honeycombed appearance.
The individual actinomyces colonies are lodged in the spaces or interstices
formed by the meshwork of the connective tissue. There they are surrounded by a
mantle of cellular elements which fill up the spaces. By scraping the cut
surface of such a tumor these cell masses inclosing the fungi come away, and
the latter may be seen as pale-yellow or sulphur-yellow specks, as described
above.</p>

<p><em>Location of the disease</em>.&mdash;In cattle the disease process may be located
both externally, where it is readily detected, and in internal organs. Its
preferred seat is on the bones of the lower and upper jaws, in the parotid
salivary gland in the angle of the jaw, and in the region of the throat. It may
also appear under the skin in different parts of the body. Internally it may
attack the tongue and appear in the form of a tumor in the mouth, pharynx, or
larynx. It may cause extensive disease of the lungs, more rarely of the
digestive tract.</p>

<p>It appears, furthermore, that in certain districts or countries the disease
seems by preference to attack certain parts. Thus in England actinomycosis of
the tongue is most prevalent. In Denmark the soft parts of the head are most
prone to disease, while in Russia the lips are the usual seat. In certain parts
of Germany actinomycotic tumors are most frequently encountered in the throat
region and in the jawbones.</p>

<p>A description of actinomycosis of the jaw (lumpy jaw) and of the tongue has
already been given in a previous chapter, and hence they will be dealt with
here only very briefly. When the disease attacks the soft parts of the head a
rather firm swelling appears, in which are formed one or more smaller
projecting tumors, varying from the size of a nut to that of an egg. These push
their way outward and finally break through the skin as small, reddish,
funguslike bodies covered with thin sloughs. Or the original swelling, in place
of enlarging in the manner described, may become transformed into an abscess
which finally bursts to discharge creamy pus. The abscess <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>cavity, however, does
not disappear, but is soon filled with fungus-like growths, which force their
way outward through the opening.</p>

<p>When the tumors are situated within the cavity of the pharynx they have
broken through from some gland, perhaps beneath the mucous membrane, where the
disease first appeared, and hang or project into the cavity of the pharynx,
either as pendulous masses with slender stems or as tumors with broad bases.
Their position may be such as to interfere with swallowing and with breathing.
In either case serious symptoms will soon appear.</p>

<p>The invasion of the bones of the jaws by actinomycosis must be regarded as
one of the most serious forms of the disease. (<a href="#PLATE_XXXIX">Pls.&nbsp;XXXIX</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#PLATE_XL">XL</a>.)
It may start in the marrow of the bone and by a slow extension gradually
undermine the entire thickness of the bone itself. The growth may continue
outward, and after working its way through muscle and skin finally break
through and appear externally as stinking fungoid growths. The growth may
at the same time work its way inward and appear in the mouth. The disease
may also begin in the periosteum, or covering of the bone, and destroy the
bone from without inward.</p>

<p>Actinomycosis of the lungs is occasionally observed, and it is not
improbable that at times it has been mistaken for tuberculosis. The actinomyces
grains are, however, easily observed if the diseased tissue is carefully
examined. The changes in the lungs as they appear to the naked eye vary
considerably from case to case. Thus in one animal the lungs were affected as
in ordinary bronchopneumonia as to the location, extent, and appearance of the
disease process. The affected lobes had a dark-red flesh appearance, with
yellowish areas sprinkled in here and there. (See <a href="#PLATE_XLI">Pl.
XLI</a>, figs. 1, 2.) These latter areas were the seat of multiplication of the
actinomyces fungus. In another case, of which only a small portion of the lungs
was sent to the laboratory, they were completely transformed into a uniformly
grayish mass, very soft and pulpy to the touch, and appearing like very soft
and moist dough. (<a href="#PLATE_XLI">Pl. XLI</a>, fig. 3.) The actinomyces
grains were exceedingly abundant in this tissue, and appeared when the tissue
was incised as minute sulphur-yellow grains, densely sprinkled through the
tissue, which readily came away and adhered to the knife blade. In still
another case a portion of the lung tissue was converted into large, soft masses
from 1 to 3 inches in diameter, each partly inclosed in very dense connective
tissue. These soft, grayish-yellow masses likewise resembled moist dough in
their consistency, and the actinomyces grains, though neither very distinct nor
at all abundant, were easily fished out and identified as such. A portion of
this growth, which was as large as a child's head, was converted into an
abscess filled with creamy semiliquid pus.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This case differed from the preceding in that all appearance of lung tissue
had disappeared from the diseased mass. Only on the exterior the lung tissue
could be recognized, although even there it had been largely converted into
very dense, whitish connective tissue inclosing the fungoid growth. In the
other case the external form of the lung and the shape and outline of the
lobules were preserved, but the lung tissue itself was not recognizable as
such. In the case first mentioned the changes were still less marked, and
actinomycosis would not have been suspected by a simple inspection. These few
illustrations suffice to show that actinomycosis of the lungs may appear under
quite different forms, and that the nature of the disease can be accurately
determined only by finding the fungus itself. Rarely actinomycosis attacks the
body externally in places other than the head and neck. Crookshank describes
the case of a bull in which the flank was attacked and subsequently the scrotum
became diseased. A large portion of the skin of the flank was destroyed and
covered with a leathery crust. When this was pulled away the pus beneath it
showed the actinomyces grains to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Actinomycosis may also involve the udder, the spermatic cord of castrated
animals, the vagina, and, when it becomes generalized, the brain, liver,
spleen, and muscular tissue.</p>

<p>Actinomycosis may in some cases be confounded with tuberculosis. The
diagnosis does not offer any difficulties, since the presence of the
actinomyces fungus at once removes any existing doubts. As has already been
intimated, these grains, simulating sulphur balls, are visible to the naked
eye, and their nature is readily determined with the aid of a microscope.</p>

<p>The course of the disease is quite slow. As the tumors grow they may
interfere with the natural functions of the body. According to their situation,
mastication, rumination, or breathing may be interfered with, and in this way
the animal may become emaciated. Actinomycosis of the jawbones leads to
destruction of the teeth and impedes the movements necessary to chewing the
feed. Similarly, when the disease attacks the soft parts of the head
obstructions may arise in the mouth by an inward growth of the tumor. If tumors
exist in the pharynx they may partially obstruct the movements necessary to
breathing, or close the air passages and cause partial suffocation.
Actinomycosis of the tongue, in interfering with the many and varied movements
of this important organ, is also a serious matter. There is no reason to
suppose that the localized disease interferes with the general health in any
other way than indirectly until internal organs, such as the lungs, become
involved.</p>

<p>A very small proportion of the cases may recover spontaneously, the tumors
being encysted or undergoing calcification. In most cases <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>the disease yields readily
to proper treatment, and about 75 per cent of the affected animals may
be cured.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;The question as to how and where animals take this disease
is one concerning which we are still in the stage of conjecture, because so far
we possess very little information concerning the life history of the
actinomyces itself. The quite unanimous view of all observers is that animals
become infected from the feed. The fungus is lodged upon the plants and in some
way enters the tissues of the head, the lungs, and the digestive tract, where
it sets up its peculiar activity. It is likewise generally believed that the
fungus is, as it were, inoculated into the affected part. This inoculation is
performed by the sharp and pointed parts of plants which penetrate the mucous
membrane and carry the fungus with them. The disease is therefore inoculable
rather than contagious. The mere presence of the diseased animal will not give
rise to disease in healthy animals unless the actinomyces grains pass directly
from the diseased into some wound or abrasion of the healthy or else drop upon
the feed which is consumed by the healthy. Not only are these views deducible
from clinical observation, but they have been proved by the positive
inoculation of calves and smaller animals with actinomyces. The danger
therefore of the presence of actinomyces for healthy animals is a limited one.
Nevertheless an animal affected with this disease should not be allowed to go
at large or run with other animals. If the fungus is being scattered by
discharging growths we certainly can not state at this stage of our knowledge
that other animals may not be infected by such distribution, and we must
assume, until more positive information is at hand, that this actually
occurs.</p>

<p>It is, however, the opinion of the majority of authorities that when
actinomycosis appears among a large number of animals they all contract it in
the same way from the feed. Much speculation has therefore arisen whether any
particular plant or group of plants is the source of the infection and whether
any special condition of the soil favors it. Very little positive information
is at hand on these questions. It would be very desirable for those who live in
localities where this disease is prevalent to make statistical and other
observations on the occurrence of the disease with reference to the season of
the year, the kind of feed, the nature of the soil (whether swampy or dry,
recently reclaimed, or cultivated for a long time) upon which the animals are
pastured or upon which the feed is grown.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that such investigations will lead to an understanding
of the source of the fungus and the means for checking the spread of the
disease itself. Veterinarian Jensen, of Denmark, made some observations upon an
extensive outbreak of actinomycosis <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446"
id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>a number of years ago which led him to
infer that the animals were inoculated by eating barley straw harvested from
pieces of ground just reclaimed from the sea. While the animals remained
unaffected so long as they pastured on this ground or ate the hay obtained from
it, they became diseased after eating the straw of cereals from the same
territory. Others have found that cattle grazing upon low pastures along the
banks of streams and subject to inundations are more prone to the disease. It
has also been observed that feed gathered from such grounds, even after
prolonged drying, may give rise to the disease. Actinomycosis is not infrequent
in cattle in the Southwest and is generally supposed to be the result of eating
the prickly fruit of the cactus plant, causing wounds of the mucous membrane
and subsequent infection with the parasite. Much additional information of a
similar kind must be forthcoming before the source and manner of infection in
this disease and its dependence upon external conditions will be known. It is
not at all improbable that they may vary considerably from place to place.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Until recently this has been almost entirely surgical. When
the tumors are external and attached to soft parts only, an early removal may
lead to recovery. This, of course, can be undertaken only by a trained
veterinarian, especially as the various parts of the head and neck contain
important vessels, nerves, and ducts which should be injured as little as
possible in any operation. Unless the tumor is completely removed it will
reappear. Disease of the jawbones is at best a very serious matter and
treatment is liable to be of no avail.</p>

<p>In March, 1892, an important contribution to our knowledge of this subject
was made by Nocard, of the Alfort Veterinary School, in a communication to the
French Central Society of Veterinary Medicine. He showed clearly that the
actinomycosis of the tongue, a disease which appears to be quite common in
Germany, and is there known as "wooden tongue," could be quickly and
permanently cured by the administration of iodid of potassium. Nocard calls
attention to the success of Thomassen, of Utrecht, who recommended this
treatment so long ago as 1885, and who has since treated more than 80 cases,
all of which have been cured. A French veterinarian, Godbille, has used the
same remedy in a number of cases of actinomycosis in the tongue, all of which
have been cured. Nocard also gives details of a case which was cured by
himself.</p>

<p>All the cases referred to were of actinomycosis of the tongue, and no one
appears to have attempted the cure of actinomycosis of the jaw until it was
undertaken by NÃ¶rgaard, of the Bureau of Animal Industry. In April, 1892, he
selected a young steer in fair condition which had a tumor on the jaw measuring
15&frac12; inches in circumference and from which a discharge had already been
established. This <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg
447]</a></span>animal was treated with iodid of potassium, and the result
was a complete cure.</p>

<p>The iodid of potassium is given in doses of 1&frac12; and 2&frac12; drams once a
day, dissolved in water, and administered as a drench. The dose should vary
somewhat with the size of the animal and with the effects that are produced. If
the dose is sufficiently large signs of iodism appear in the course of a week
or 10 days. The skin becomes scurfy, there is weeping from the eyes, catarrh of
the nose, and loss of appetite. When these symptoms appear the medicine may be
suspended for a few days and afterward resumed in the same dose. The cure
requires from three to six weeks' treatment. Some animals, generally the ones
which show no signs of iodism, do not improve under treatment with iodid of
potassium.</p>

<p>If there is no sign of improvement after the animals have been treated four
or five weeks, and the medicine has been given in as large doses as appear
desirable, it is an indication that the particular animal is not susceptible to
the curative effects of the drug, and the treatment may therefore be
abandoned.</p>

<p>It is not, however, advisable to administer iodid of potassium to milch
cows, as it will considerably reduce the milk secretion or stop it altogether.
Furthermore, a great part of the drug is excreted through the milk, making the
milk unfit for use. It should not be given to animals in advanced pregnancy, as
there is danger of producing abortion.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained by pushing the drug until its effect is seen.
The many tests to which this treatment has been subjected have proved, with few
exceptions, its specific curative value. In addition to this the tumor should
be painted externally with either the tincture of iodin or Lugol's solution, or
the drug should be injected subcutaneously into the tumor.</p>

<p>Godbille has given as much as 4 drams of potassium iodid in one day to a
steer, decreasing the dose one-fourth dram each day until the dose was 1&frac14;
drams, which was maintained until the twelfth day of treatment, when the animal
appeared to be entirely cured.</p>

<p>Nocard gave the first day 1&frac12; drams in one dose to a cow; the second and
succeeding days a dose of 1 dram in the morning and evening, in each case
before feeding. This treatment was continued for 10 days, when the animal was
cured.</p>

<p><em>Actinomycosis and the public health</em>.&mdash;The interest which is shown
concerning this cattle disease is largely due to the fact that the same disease
attacks human beings. Its slow progress, its tendency to remain restricted to
certain localities, and the absence of any directly contagious properties have
thus far not aroused any anxiety in other countries as to its influence on the
cattle industry, not even to the point of placing it among the infectious
diseases of which statistics <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">
[Pg 448]</a></span>are annually published. Its possible bearing on public health
has, however, given the disease a place in the public mind which it hardly deserves.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the actinomyces fungus found in human
disease is considered by authorities the same as that occurring in bovine
affections. It is therefore of interest to conclude this article with a brief
discussion of the disease in man and its relation to actinomycosis in
cattle.</p>

<p>In man the location of the disease process corresponds fairly well to that
in cattle. The majority of cases which have been reported in different parts of
the world&mdash;and they are now rather numerous&mdash;indicate disease of the
face. The skin, tongue, or the jawbones may become affected, and by a very slow
process it may extend downward upon the neck and even into the cavity of the
chest. In many cases the teeth have been found in a state of more or less
advanced decay and ulceration. In a few cases disease of the lungs was observed
without coexisting disease of the bones or soft parts of the head. In such
cases the fungus must have been inhaled. The disease of the lungs after a time
extends upon the chest wall, where it may corrode the ribs and work its way
through the muscles and the skin. An abscess is thus formed discharging pus
containing actinomyces grains. Disease of the digestive organs caused by this
fungus has also been observed in a few instances.</p>

<p>Granting the identity of the disease in man and cattle, the question has
been raised whether cattle are responsible for its occurrence in man. Any
transmission of the infectious agent may be conceived of as taking place during
the life of the animal and from the meat after slaughter. That human beings
have contracted actinomycosis by coming in contact with diseased cattle is not
shown by the cases that have been reported, for the occupations of most of the
patients did not bring them into any relation whatever with cattle. While the
possibility of such direct transmission is not denied, nevertheless it must be
considered as extremely remote. Practically the same position is maintained at
present by most authorities as regards the transmission of the disease to man
by eating meat. Israel, who has studied this question carefully, found the
disease in Jews who never ate pork,<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and who
likewise were protected from bovine actinomycosis by the rigorous meat
inspection practiced by that race. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that
actinomycosis is a local disease, causing great destruction of tissue where the
fungus multiplies, but which very rarely becomes generally disseminated over
the body from the original disease focus. The fungus is found only in
places where the disease process is manifest to the eye or becomes so in a very
short time after the lodgment of the fungus. Only the greatest negligence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
would allow the actually diseased parts to be sold and consumed. Finally, this
parasite, like all others, would be destroyed in the process of cooking. Most
authorities thus do not believe that actinomycosis in man is directly traceable
to the disease in animals, but are of the opinion that both man and animals are
infected from a third source, which has already been discussed above. How far
these views may be modified by further and more telling investigations of the
parasite fungus itself no one can predict. There are still wide gaps in our
knowledge, and the presentation above simply summarizes the prevailing views,
from which there are dissenters, of course. An attempt to give the views of
both sides on this question would necessitate the summarizing and impartial
discussion of all the experiments thus far made&mdash;a task entirely beyond
the scope of the present work.</p>

<p>Whether an animal affected with actinomycosis should be used for human food
after all diseased organs and tissues have been thoroughly removed is a
question the answer to which depends on a variety of circumstances. Among these
may be mentioned the thoroughness of the meat inspection itself, the extent of
the disease, and the general condition of the animal affected.</p>

<p>The Federal meat-inspection regulations require that carcasses of animals
showing generalized actinomycosis shall be condemned. If carcasses are in a
well-nourished condition, showing uncomplicated localized lesions of
actinomycosis, they may be passed after the infected organs or parts have been
removed and condemned. When the disease of the jaw is slight, strictly
localized, and without pus formation, fistulous tracts, or lymph-gland
involvement, the tongue, if free from disease, may be passed. The heads
affected with actinomycosis (lumpy jaw), including the tongue, shall be
condemned, except that when the lesions in the jaw are strictly localized and
slight in extent, the tongue may be passed, if free from disease.</p>

<h4>ANTHRAX.</h4>

<p>Anthrax or charbon may be defined as an infectious disease which is caused
by specific bacteria, known as anthrax bacilli, and which is more or less
restricted by conditions of soil and moisture to definite geographical
localities. While it is chiefly limited to cattle and sheep, it may be
transmitted to goats, horses, cats, and certain kinds of game. Smaller animals,
such as mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs, speedily succumb to inoculation. Dogs
and hogs are slightly susceptible, while fowls are practically immune. The
variety of domesticated animals which it may attack renders it one of the most
dreaded scourges of animal life. It may even attack man. Of this more will be
stated further on.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;The cause of anthrax is a microscopic organism known as the
anthrax bacillus. (See <a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Pl. XXVIII</a>, fig. 7.) In form
it is cylindrical or rodlike, measuring 1/5000 to 1/2500 inch in length and
1/25000 inch in diameter. Like all bacteria, these rodlike bodies have the
power of indefinite multiplication, and in the bodies of infected animals they
produce death by rapidly increasing in numbers and producing substances which
poison the body. In the blood they multiply in number by becoming elongated and
then dividing into two, each new organism continuing the same process
indefinitely. Outside the body, however, they multiply in a different way when
under conditions unfavorable to growth. Oval bodies, which are called spores,
appear within the rods, and remain alive and capable of germination after years
of drying. They also resist heat to a remarkable degree, so that boiling water
is necessary to destroy them. The bacilli themselves, on the other hand, show
only very little resistance to heat and drying. It has long been known that the
anthrax virus thrives best under certain conditions of the soil and on
territories subject to floods and inundations. The particular kinds of soil
upon which the disease is observed are black, loose, warm, humous soils; also
those containing lime, marl, and clay, finally peaty, swampy soils resting upon
strata which hold the water, or, in other words, are impervious. Hence fields
containing stagnant pools may be the source of infection. The infection may be
limited to certain farms, or even to restricted areas on such farms. Even in
the Alps, more than 3,000 feet above sea level, where such conditions prevail
in secluded valleys, anthrax persists among herds.</p>

<p>Aside from these limitations to specific conditions of the soil, anthrax is
a disease of world-wide distribution. It exists in most countries of Europe, in
Asia, Africa, Australia, and in our own country in the lower Mississippi
Valley, the Gulf States, and in some of the Eastern and Western States. It
seems to be gradually spreading in this country and every year occurs in new
districts.</p>

<p>Meteorological conditions also have an important share in determining the
severity of the disease. On those tracts subject to inundations in spring a
very hot, dry summer is liable to cause a severe outbreak. The relation which
the bacillus bears to these conditions is not positively known. It may be that
during and immediately after inundations or in stagnant water the bacilli find
nourishment enough in the water here and there to multiply and produce an
abundant crop of spores, which are subsequently carried, in a dry condition, by
the winds during the period of drought and disseminated over the vegetation.
Animals feeding upon this vegetation may contract the disease if the spores
germinate in the body.</p>

<p>Another source of the virus, and one regarded by many authorities as perhaps
the most important, is the body of an animal which has <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>died of anthrax. It will
be remembered that in such bodies the anthrax bacilli are present in great
numbers, and wherever blood or other body fluids are exposed to the air on the
surface of the carcass there the formation of spores will go on with great
rapidity in the warm season of the year. It will thus be readily understood how
this disease may become stationary in a given locality and appear year after
year and even grow in severity if the carcasses of animals which have succumbed
to it are not properly disposed of. These carcasses should be buried deeply, so
that spore formation may be prevented and no animal have access to them. By
exercising this precaution the disease will not be disseminated by flies and
other insect pests.</p>

<p>We have thus two agents at work in maintaining the disease in any
locality&mdash;the soil and meteorological conditions, and the carcasses of
animals that have died of the disease. Besides these dangers, which are of
immediate consequence to cattle on pastures, the virus may be carried from
place to place in hides, hair, wool, hoofs, and horns, and it may be stored in
the hay or other fodder from the infected fields and cause an outbreak among
stabled animals feeding upon it in winter. In this manner the affection has
been introduced into far-distant localities.</p>

<p><em>How cattle are infected</em>.&mdash;We have seen above that the spores of the
anthrax bacilli, which in their functions correspond to the seeds of higher
plants and which are the elements that longest resist the unfavorable
conditions in the soil, air, and water, are the chief agents of infection. They
may be taken into the body with the feed and produce disease which begins in
the intestinal tract, or they may come in contact with scratches, bites, or
other wounds of the skin, mouth, and tongue, and produce in these situations
swellings or carbuncles. From such swellings the bacilli penetrate into the
blood and produce a general disease.</p>

<p>It has likewise been asserted that the disease may be transmitted by various
kinds of insects which carry the bacilli from the sick and inoculate the
healthy as they pierce the skin. When infection of the blood takes place from
the intestines the carbuncles may be absent. It has already been stated that
since anthrax spores live for several years, the disease may be contracted in
winter from feed gathered on permanently infected fields.</p>

<p>The disease may appear sporadically, i. e., only one or several animals may
be infected while the rest of the herd remain well, or it may appear as an
epizootic attacking a large number at about the same time.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The symptoms in cattle vary considerably, according as the
disease begins in the skin, in the lungs, or in the intestines. They depend
also on the severity of the attack. Thus we may have what is called anthrax
peracutus or apoplectiform, when the animal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453"
id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>dies very suddenly as if from
apoplexy. Such cases usually occur in the beginning of an outbreak. The animal,
without having shown any signs of disease, suddenly drops in the pasture and
dies in convulsions, or one apparently well at night is found dead in the
morning.</p>

<p>The second type (anthrax acutis), without any external swellings, is the one
most commonly observed in cattle. The disease begins with a high fever. The
temperature may reach 106Â° to 107Â° F. The pulse beats from 80 to 100 a minute.
Feeding and rumination are suspended. Chills and muscular tremors may appear
and the skin show uneven temperature. The ears and base of the horns are cold,
the coat staring. The animals are dull and stupid and manifest great
weakness.</p>

<p>To these symptoms others are added in the course of the disease. The
dullness may give way to great uneasiness, champing of the jaws, spasms of the
limbs, kicking and pawing the ground. The breathing may become labored. The
nostrils then dilate, the mouth is open, the head raised, and all muscles of
the chest are strained during breathing, while the visible mucous membranes
(nose, mouth, rectum, and vagina) become bluish. If the disease has started in
the bowels, there is much pain, as shown by the moaning of the animal; the
discharges, at first firm, become softer and covered with serum, mucus,
and blood.</p>

<p>As the disease approaches the fatal termination the weakness of the animal
increases. It leans against supports or lies down. Blood vessels may rupture
and give rise to spots of blood on the various mucous membranes and bloody
discharges from nose, mouth, rectum, and vagina. The urine not infrequently
contains blood (red water), and death ensues within one or two days.</p>

<p>A third type of the disease (anthrax subacutus), which is rarely observed,
includes those cases in which the disease is more prolonged. It may last from
three to seven days and terminate fatally or end in recovery. In this type, the
symptoms are practically as described in the acute form, only less marked.</p>

<p>In connection with these types of intestinal anthrax, swellings may appear
in different parts of the body under the skin, or the disease may start from
such a swelling, caused by the inoculation of anthrax spores in one of the
several different ways already described. If the disease begins in the skin, it
agrees in general with the subacute form in prolonged duration, and it may
occasionally terminate in recovery if the swellings are thoroughly incised and
treated.</p>

<p><em>Lesions</em>.&mdash;These swellings appear as edemas and carbuncles. The former
are doughy tumors of a more or less flattish form passing gradually into the
surrounding healthy tissue. As a rule, they are situated beneath the skin in
the fatty layer, and the skin itself is at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454"
id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>first of healthy appearance, so that
they are often overlooked, especially when covered with a good coat of hair.
When they are cut open they are found to consist of a peculiar, jellylike mass
of a yellowish color and more or less stained with blood. The carbuncles are
firm, hot, tender swellings, which later become cool and painless and undergo
mortification. The edemas and carbuncles may also appear in the mouth, pharynx,
larynx, in the tongue, and in the rectum.</p>

<p>The bodies of cattle which have died of anthrax soon lose their rigidity and
become bloated, because decomposition sets in very rapidly. From the mouth,
nose, and anus bloodstained fluid flows in small quantities. When such
carcasses are opened and examined it is found that nearly all organs are
sprinkled with spots of blood or extravasations of various sizes. The spleen is
enlarged from two to five times, the pulp blackish and soft and occasionally
disintegrated. The blood is of tarry consistency, not firmly coagulated, and
blackish in color. In the abdomen, the thoracic cavity, and in the pericardium,
or bag surrounding the heart, more or less blood-stained fluid is present. In
addition to these characteristic signs, the carbuncles and swellings under the
skin, already described, will aid in determining the true nature of the
disease. The most reliable method of diagnosis is the examination of the blood
and tissues for anthrax bacilli, which requires a trained bacteriologist. The
cases of fatal anthrax number from 70 to 90 per cent, and are usually more
numerous at the first outbreak of the disease.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;The diagnosis from blackleg may be made by
noting the subcutaneous swellings which appear upon the patient. Those of
blackleg are found to crackle under pressure with the finger, owing to the
presence of gas within the tissues, while the tumors of anthrax, being caused
by the pressure of serum, are entirely free from this quality and have a
somewhat doughy consistence. The tumors of blackleg are usually on the shoulder
or thigh and are not found so frequently about the neck and side of the body as
are the swellings of anthrax. The blood of animals dead of blackleg is normal,
and the spleen does not appear swollen or darkened, as in those affected with
anthrax. The chief differences between anthrax and Texas fever are that the
course of the former is more acute and the blood of the animal is dark and of a
tarlike consistence, while in the latter it is thinner than normal. The
presence of Texas-fever ticks on the cattle would also lead one to suspect that
disease in regions where cattle are not immune from it.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In cases which originate from external wounds, the
swellings should be opened freely by long incisions with a sharp knife and
washed several times daily with carbolic-acid solution (1 ounce to a quart of
water). Care should be taken to disinfect thoroughly any fluid discharge that
may follow the incision. When suppuration <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455"
id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>has set in the treatment recommended in the
chapter on wounds should be carried out.</p>

<p>In the treatment of animals showing symptoms of anthrax, the serum
recommended under the next heading of "Prevention" should be administered in
large doses. Animals showing only a high temperature with no other symptoms of
the disease should be given from 30 to 50 cubic centimeters of the serum, but
if the gravity of the disease is pronounced 100 cubic centimeters should be
administered. In most instances a drop in temperature may be observed and a
diminishing of the severity of the symptoms. At times, however, a relapse
occurs about the second or third day following the serum injection, when it
becomes necessary to administer another dose of serum. It has been proved that
animals affected with anthrax may recover after injections of potent serum.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;In this disease prevention is the most important subject
demanding consideration. The various means to be suggested may be brought under
two heads: (1) The surroundings of the animal, and (2) preventive
inoculation.</p>

<p>(1) Surroundings.&mdash;What has already been stated of those conditions of
the pastures which are favorable to anthrax, after a little thought, will
suggest to most minds some of the preventive measures which may be of
service in reducing losses in anthrax localities. All that conduces to a better
state of the soil should be attempted. The State or Nation, by appropriate
engineering, should do its share in preventing frequent inundations. If pools
of stagnant water exist in the pastures, or if any particular portions are
known by experience to give rise to anthrax, they should be fenced off. Efforts
should likewise be made toward the proper draining of swamp lands frequented by
cattle. Sometimes it has been found desirable to abandon for a season any
infected or dangerous pastures. This remedy can not be carried out by most
farmers, and it is liable to extend the infected territory. In some instances
withdrawal of cattle from pastures entirely and feeding them in stables is said
to have reduced the losses.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that carcasses of animals which have died of
anthrax be properly disposed of, as every portion of such animal contains the
bacilli, ready to form spores when exposed to the air. Perhaps the simplest
means is to bury the carcasses deep, where they can not be exposed by dogs or
wild animals. It may be necessary to bury them on the pasture, but it is better
to remove them to places not frequented by susceptible animals and to a point
where drainage from the graves can not infect any water supply.</p>

<p>If they are moved some distance it must be borne in mind that the ground and
all objects which have come in contact with the carcass should be disinfected.
This is best accomplished with chlorid of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456"
id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>lime. For washing utensils, etc., a 5 per cent
solution may be prepared by adding 3 ounces to 2 quarts of water. This should
be prepared fresh from the powder, and it is but little trouble to have a small
tin measure of known capacity to dip out the powder, to be added to the water
whenever necessary. The carcass and the ground should be sprinkled with powdered
chlorid, or, if this is not at hand, an abundance of ordinary, unslaked lime
should be used in its place.</p>

<p>The removal of carcasses to rendering establishments is always fraught with
danger, unless those who handle them are thoroughly aware of the danger of
scattering the virus by careless handling in wagons that are not tight. As a
rule, the persons in charge of such transfer have no training for this
important work, so that deep burial is to be preferred. Burning large carcasses
is not always feasible; it is, however, the most certain means of destroying
infectious material of any kind, and should be resorted to whenever practicable
and economical. All carcasses, whether buried, rendered, or burned, should be
disposed of unopened. When stables have become infected they should be
thoroughly cleaned out, and the solution of chlorid of lime freely applied on
floors and woodwork. The feed should be carefully protected from contamination
with the manure or other discharges from the sick.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">Preventive inoculation</span>.&mdash;One of the most
important discoveries in connection with the disease was made by Louis
Pasteur in 1881, and consisted in the new principle of producing immunity by
the inoculation of weakened cultures of the bacillus causing the disease. This
method has been quite extensively adopted in France, and to some extent in
other European countries, and in the United States. The fluid used for
inoculation consists of bouillon in which modified anthrax bacilli have
multiplied and are present in large numbers. The bacilli have been modified by
heat so that to a certain degree they have lost their original virulence. Two
vaccines are prepared. The first or weaker, for the first inoculation, is
obtained by subjecting the bacilli to the attenuating effects of heat for a
longer period of time than in the case of the second, or stronger vaccine, for
a second inoculation some 12 days later.</p>

<p>There are several difficulties inherent in the practical application of
Pasteur's vaccine. Among them may be mentioned the variable degree of
attenuation of different tubes of the vaccine and the varying susceptibility of
the animals to be inoculated. The use of this vaccine is increasing,
nevertheless, and has reduced the mortality in the affected districts from an
average of 10 per cent in the case of sheep, to less than 1 per cent, and from
5 per cent with cattle, to less than one-half of 1 per cent.</p>

<p>It is very important to call attention to the possibility of distributing
anthrax by this method of protective inoculation, as the <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>bacilli themselves are
present in the culture liquid. It is true that they have been modified and
weakened by the process adopted by Pasteur, but it is not impossible for such
modified virus to regain its original virulence after it has been scattered
broadcast by the inoculation of large herds. It is obviously unsafe to have
such vaccine injected by a layman; instead, it should be handled only by a
competent veterinarian.</p>

<p>There are other disadvantages in this method of vaccination, and they all
must be given due consideration. The unstable keeping quality of the Pasteur
vaccine is a very important factor to be considered. Experience in this line
has proved that Pasteur vaccine may deteriorate within a very short time after
its preparation, and in repeated instances it has proved inert within three
months of its preparation. When exposed to warm temperature and light, it
deteriorates very rapidly; and when it is considered that the products of
manufacturers may be stored under unfavorable conditions in branch houses and
on the shelves of rural drug stores, the loss of potency can be readily
explained. These deficiencies have been recognized by many investigators, and
because of the superior keeping qualities particular attention has been
directed toward the preparation of a spore vaccine by Zenkowsky of Russia,
Detre of Hungary, and Nitta of Japan. For the purpose of producing a spore
vaccine it is desirable to use a peptone-free agar medium, and after
inoculation with an attenuated culture of the anthrax bacillus, it is allowed
to grow at a temperature of 37Â° C. for 4 to 7 days. By this time an abundance
of spores will have formed. The growth is then collected in sterile flasks and
heated to a temperature of 60Â° C. for one-half hour to destroy the vegetative
forms of the organism. If it is desired to use for vaccination one million
spores, it is advisable to dilute the vaccine to a quantity of which 1 cubic
centimeter would contain this number. Of such a vaccine 1 cubic centimeter
would constitute the dose for cattle and horses. In all forms of vaccination
against anthrax in sheep the greatest care must be exercised, as these animals
are very susceptible to the disease, and at times vaccines which have no ill
effects on cattle will prove fatal to sheep. Therefore the dose of the spore
vaccine for sheep should not be more than one-fourth of that given to
cattle.</p>

<p>Sclavo, Sobernheim, and others have established that injections of
increasing quantities of virulent cultures into immune animals produced a serum
which has great protective value against anthrax. Such protective serum may be
produced in the various susceptible animals.</p>

<p>For immunization purposes it is advisable to use the simultaneous method;
that is, both the spore vaccine and the anthrax serum should be injected. It is
desirable to divide the herd to be treated into <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458"
id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>groups of ten or twelve and inject, first,
each animal of the group with the serum, following this with the injection of
the spore vaccine. The serum should be injected on one side, either on the
neck or back of the shoulder, and the spore vaccine on the other side, injections
being made subcutaneously. In herds in which the disease has already made its
appearance it is necessary to take the temperatures of all the animals and to
subject to the simultaneous vaccination only those that show no rise in temperature.
All others should be given the serum-alone treatment in doses varying in accordance
with the severity of the symptoms manifested by the individual animals. If the
examination reveals a considerable number of infections, it is advisable to use
the serum alone for all the animals, and in three or four weeks to revaccinate
by the simultaneous method. The dosage should depend on the potency of the
serum, serum of a high potency naturally being most desirable. Thus serum in
10 cubic centimeter doses for large animals, and 3 to 5 cubic centimeter doses
for smaller ones, has been found to be effective in producing a temporary
immunity.</p>

<p>As anthrax is entirely different from blackleg, vaccine for the latter does
not act as a preventive against the former.</p>

<h4>ANTHRAX IN MAN (MALIGNANT PUSTULE, OR CARBUNCLE).</h4>

<p>Anthrax may be transmitted to man in handling the carcasses and hides of
animals which have succumbed to the disease. The infection usually takes place
through some abrasion or slight wound of the skin into which the anthrax
spores, or bacilli, find their way. The point of inoculation appears at first
as a dark point or patch, compared by some writers to the sting of a flea.
After a few hours this is changed into a reddened pimple, which bears on its
summit, usually around a hair, a yellowish blister, or vesicle, which later
on becomes red or bluish in color. The burning sensation in this stage is very
great. Later this pimple enlarges, its center becomes dry, gangrenous, and is
surrounded by an elevated, discolored swelling. The center becomes drier and
more leatherlike, and sinks in as the whole increases in size. The skin around
this swelling or carbuncle is stained yellow or bluish, and is not infrequently
swollen and doughy to the touch. The carbuncle itself rarely grows larger than
a pea or a small nut, and is but slightly painful.</p>

<p>Anthrax swellings or edemas, already described as occurring in cattle, may
also be found in man, and they are at times so extensive as to produce
distortion in the appearance of the part of the body on which they are found.
The color of the skin over these swellings varies according to the situation
and thickness of the skin and the stage of the disease, and may be white, red,
bluish, or blackish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
As sooner or later these carbuncles and swellings may lead to an infection
of the entire body, and thus be fatal, surgical assistance should at once be
called if there is well-grounded suspicion that any swellings resembling those
described above have been caused by inoculation with anthrax virus. Inasmuch as
physicians differ as to medicinal treatment of such accidents in man, it would
be out of place to make any suggestions in this connection.</p>

<p>Extensive data are available, however, on the effectiveness of anthrax serum
for the treatment of the disease in man. It is recommended that from 30 to 40
cubic centimeters of serum be injected in three or four different places.
Should no improvement follow in 24 hours additional injections of 20 to 30
cubic centimeters should be administered.</p>

<p>In most instances the results are favorable, and this treatment is
acknowledged to be superior to any other mode of treatment known for the
disease.</p>

<p>To show that the transmission of anthrax to man is not so very uncommon, we
take the following figures from the 1890 report of the German Government: The
attention of the authorities was brought to 111 cases, of which 11 terminated
fatally. The largest number of inoculations were caused by the slaughtering,
opening, and skinning of animals affected with anthrax; hence, the butchers
suffered most extensively. Of the 111 thus affected, 36 belonged to this craft.
Infected shaving brushes also are very dangerous.</p>

<p>In addition to anthrax of the skin (known as malignant pustule), human
beings are subject, though very rarely, to the disease of the lungs and the
digestive organs. In the former case the spores are inhaled by workmen in
establishments in which wool, hides, and rags are worked over, and it is
therefore known as woolsorter's disease. In the latter case the disease is
contracted by eating the flesh of diseased animals which has not been
thoroughly cooked. These forms of the disease are more fatal than those in
which the disease starts from the skin.</p>

<h4>BLACKLEG.</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XLII">Pl. XLII</a>.]</h5>

<p>Blackleg, black quarter, quarter ill, symptomatic anthrax, charbon
symptomatique of the French, Rauschbrand of the Germans, is a rapidly fatal,
infectious disease of young cattle, associated with external swellings which
emit a crackling sound when handled. This disease was formerly regarded
identical with anthrax, but investigations by various scientists in recent
times have definitely proved the entire dissimilarity of the two affections,
both from a clinical and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">
[Pg 460]</a></span>causal standpoint. The disease is produced by a specific
bacillus, readily distinguishable from that causing anthrax.
(<a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Pl. XXVIII</a>, fig. 4.) Cattle between 6 months and 2
years of age are the most susceptible. Sucking calves under 6 months are rarely
attacked, nor are they so susceptible to inoculation as older animals. Cattle
more than 2 years of age may become affected, but such cases are infrequent.
Sheep and goats may also contract the disease, but man, horses, hogs, dogs,
cats, and fowls appear to be immune.</p>

<p>Like anthrax, blackleg is more or less restricted to definite localities.
There are certain pastures upon which the disease regularly appears in the
summer and fall of the year. As to any peculiarities of the soil nothing is
definitely known. Some authors are inclined to regard moist, undrained, and
swampy pastures favorable to this disease, but these theories will hardly hold,
as it is found in all kinds of soil, in all altitudes, at all seasons of the
year, and under various climatic conditions. It occurs in this country from the
Atlantic to the Pacific and from Mexico to Canada, but it is more prevalent in
the Western and Southwestern States. In Europe it exists in France, various
parts of Germany, in Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Italy, and in the Alps of
Switzerland. In Africa it occurs in Algeria and to some extent in Natal and
bordering countries. In South America it prevails quite extensively throughout
Argentina. Cattle in Cuba and Australia also suffer.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;The cause of the disease is a bacillus resembling in some minor
respects the anthrax bacillus and differing but little from it in size. It also
possesses the power of forming within itself a spore. In Plate XXVIII, figure
4, this is represented as an uncolored spot located in one end of the rod,
which is enlarged so that the rod itself appears more or less club-shaped. What
has already been stated concerning the significance of the spore of the anthrax
bacillus applies equally well to these bodies. They resist destructive agents
for a considerable time, and may still produce disease when inoculated after
several years of drying. This fact may account for the occasional appearance of
blackleg in stables. In order to meet the requirements for the development of
the spores, which takes place only in the absence of the atmosphere, it is
necessary that the wound be very small and deep enough to penetrate the
subcutaneous tissue.</p>

<p>Several observers have found this organism in the mud of swamps. By placing
a little of the mud under the skin, the disease has been produced.</p>

<p>Since the disease may be produced by placing under the skin material
containing the specific bacilli and spores, it has been assumed that cattle
contract the disease through wounds, principally of the skin, or very rarely of
the mouth, tongue, and throat. Slight wounds into which the virus may find
access may be caused by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">
[Pg 461]</a></span>barbed wire, stubbles, thorns, briers, grass burs, and
sharp or pointed parts of feed. Infection by way of digestive tract is also
probable.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms and lesions</em>.&mdash;The symptoms of blackleg may be either of a
general or of a local nature, though more frequently of the latter. The general
symptoms are very much like those belonging to other acute infectious or
bacterial diseases. They begin, from one to three days after the infection has
taken place, with loss of appetite and of rumination, with dullness and
debility, and a high fever. The temperature may rise to 107Â° F. To these may be
added lameness or stiffness of one or more limbs, due to the tumor or swelling
quite invariably accompanying the disease. After a period of disease lasting
from one to three days the affected animal almost always succumbs. Death is
preceded by increasing weakness, difficult breathing, and occasional attacks of
violent convulsions.</p>

<p>The most important characteristic of this disease is the appearance of a
tumor or swelling under the skin a few hours after the setting in of the
constitutional symptoms described above. In some cases it may appear first.
This tumor may be on the thighs (hence "blackleg," "black quarter"), the neck,
the shoulder, the breast, the flanks, or the rump; never below the carpal (or
knee) and the hock joint. It more rarely appears in the throat and at the base
of the tongue. The tumor, at first small and painful, spreads very rapidly both
in depth and extent. When it is stroked or handled a peculiar crackling sound
is heard under the skin; this is due to a collection of gas formed by the
bacilli as they multiply. At this stage the skin becomes dry, parchment-like,
and cool to the touch in the center of the tumor. If the swelling is cut into,
a frothy, dark-red, rather disagreeable-smelling fluid is discharged. The
animal manifests little or no pain during the operation.</p>

<p>As it is frequently desirable to know whether the disease is anthrax or
blackleg, a few of the most obvious post-mortem changes may here be cited. The
characteristic tumor with its crackling sound when stroked has already been
described. If after the death of the animal it is more thoroughly examined, it
will be noted that the tissues under the skin are infiltrated with blood and
yellowish, jellylike material and gas bubbles. The muscular tissue beneath
the swelling may be brownish or black, shading into dark red. (<a
href="#PLATE_XLII">Pl. XLII</a>.) It is soft, easily torn and broken up. The
muscle tissue is distended with numerous smaller or larger gas-filled cavities,
often to such extent as to produce a resemblance to lung tissue. Upon incision
it does not collapse perceptibly, as the gas cavities are not connected with
one another.</p>

<p>In the abdomen and the thorax bloodstained fluid is not infrequently found,
together with bloodstaining of the lining membrane of these cavities. Blood
spots (or ecchymoses) are also found on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462"
id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>the heart and lungs. The liver is congested,
but the spleen is always normal in appearance.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;Among the features of this disease which
distinguish it from anthrax may be mentioned the unchanged spleen and the ready
clotting of the blood. It will be remembered that in anthrax the spleen (milt)
is very much enlarged, the blood tarry, coagulating feebly. The anthrax
carbuncles and swellings differ from the blackleg swellings in not containing
gas, in being hard and solid, and in causing death less rapidly.</p>

<p>It is difficult to distinguish between the swellings of blackleg and
malignant edema, as they resemble each other very closely and both are
distended with gas. Malignant edema, however, generally starts from a wound of
considerable size; it usually follows surgical operations, and seldom results
from the small abrasions and pricks to which animals are subjected in pastures.
Inoculation experiments on guinea pigs, rabbits, and chickens will generally
disclose the differences between the three diseases above, as all these species
are killed by the germ of malignant edema, only the first two species by the
anthrax bacillus, while the guinea pigs alone will succumb to the blackleg
infection. Hemorrhagic septicemia may be differentiated from blackleg by its
affecting cattle of all ages, by the location of the swelling usually about the
region of the throat, neck, and dewlap, by the soft, doughy character of the
swellings without the presence of gas bubbles, and finally by the
characteristic hemorrhages widely distributed throughout the body. Other means
of diagnosis, which have reference to the specific bacilli, to the inoculable
character of the virus upon small animals, and which are of decisive and final
importance, can be utilized only by the trained bacteriologist and
veterinarian.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;In this disease remedies have thus far proved unavailing.
Some writers recommend the use of certain drugs, which seem to have been
beneficial in a few cases, but a thorough trial has shown them to be valueless.
Others advise that the swelling be opened by deep and long incisions and a
strong disinfectant, such as a 5 per cent solution of carbolic acid, applied to
the exposed parts; but this procedure can not be too strongly condemned. As
nearly all those attacked die, in spite of every kind of treatment, and in view
of the fact that when these tumors are opened the germs of the disease are
scattered over the stables or pastures, thus becoming a source of danger to
other cattle, it is obvious that such measures do more harm than good and
should be put aside as dangerous. Bleeding, nerving, roweling, or setoning have
likewise some adherents, but the evidence indicates that they have neither
curative nor preventive value and therefore should be discarded for the method of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
vaccination which has been thoroughly tried and proved to be efficacious.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;The various means suggested under "Anthrax" to prevent the
spread or recurrence of this disease are equally applicable to blackleg, and
hence do not need to be repeated here in full. They consist in the removal of
well animals from the infected pasture to a noninfected field, the draining of
the swampy ground, the burial or burning of the carcasses to prevent the
dissemination of the germs over vast areas through the agency of dogs, wolves,
buzzards, or crows, the disinfection of the stables and the ground where the
animals lay at the time of death, and, if possible, the destruction of the
germs on the infected pastures. One of the most effective methods for freeing
an infected pasture from blackleg is to allow the grass to grow high, and when
sufficiently dry to burn it off. One burning off is not sufficient to redeem an
infected pasture, but the process should be repeated several years in
succession. This method, however, is in many instances impracticable, as few
cattle owners can afford to do it, and the only means left for the protection
of the animals is vaccination.</p>

<p><em>Immunization by vaccination</em>.&mdash;Three French veterinarians, Arloing,
Cornevin, and Thomas, were the first to discover that cattle may be protected
against blackleg by inoculation with virulent material obtained from animals
which have died of this disease. Later they devised a method of inoculation
with the attenuated or weakened blackleg spores which produced immunity from
natural or artificial inoculation of virulent blackleg germs. Their method has
undergone various modifications both in regard to the manufacture of the
vaccine and in the mode of its application. Kitt, a German scientist, modified
the method so that but one inoculation of the vaccine was required instead of
two, as was the case with that made by the French investigators. The vaccine
formerly prepared and distributed by the Bureau of Animal Industry combined the
principle of Arloing, Cornevin, and Thomas, and the modification of Kitt.</p>

<p>By vaccination we understand the injection of a minute amount of
attenuated&mdash;that is, artificially weakened&mdash;blackleg virus into the
system. This virus is obtained from animals which have died from blackleg, by
securing the affected muscles, cutting them into strips, and drying them in the
air. When they are perfectly dry they are pulverized and mixed with water to
form a paste, smeared in a thin layer on flat dishes, placed in an oven, and
heated for six hours at a temperature close to that of boiling water. The paste
is then transformed into a hard crust, which is pulverized and sifted and
distributed in packages containing either 10 or 25 doses. This constitutes the
vaccine, the strength of which is thoroughly tested on experiment animals
before it is distributed among the cattle owners. <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>This vaccine, which is in the
form of a brownish, dry powder, is mixed with definite quantities of sterile water,
filtered, and by means of a hypodermic syringe the filtrate injected under the
skin in front of the shoulder of the animal. The inoculation is usually
followed by insignificant symptoms. In a few cases there is a slight rise of
temperature, and by close observation a minute swelling may be noted at the
point of inoculation. The immunity conferred in this way may last for 18
months, but animals vaccinated before they are 6 months old and those in badly
infected districts should be revaccinated before the following blackleg
season.</p>

<p>The effect of the vaccine prepared by this bureau in preventing outbreaks of
the disease and in immediately abating outbreaks already in progress was highly
satisfactory, and it is not to be doubted that thousands of young cattle were
saved to the stock owners during the 25 years in which the vaccine was
distributed.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a
href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> More than 47,000,000 doses were
sent out during this period, and from reports received it is safe to conclude
that more than 40,000,000 were actually injected, whereby the percentage of
loss from blackleg has been reduced from 10 per cent, which annually occurred
before using, to less than one-half of 1 per cent per annum. With these figures
before us it is plain that the general introduction of preventive vaccination
must be of material benefit to the cattle raisers in the infected districts.
Moreover, there is every reason to believe that with the continued use of
blackleg vaccine in all districts where the disease is known to occur, and an
earnest effort on the part of the stock owners to prevent the reinfection of
their pastures by following the directions given, blackleg may be kept in check
and gradually eradicated.</p>

<p>Immunization against blackleg is now frequently accomplished by the use of
the so-called blackleg aggressin and blackleg filtrates.</p>

<h4>NECROTIC STOMATITIS (CALF DIPHTHERIA).</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XLIII">Pl. XLIII</a>.]</h5>

<p>Necrotic stomatitis is an acute, specific, highly contagious inflammation of
the mouth occurring in young cattle, and characterized locally by the formation
of ulcers and caseo-necrotic patches and by constitutional symptoms, chiefly
toxic.</p>

<p>This disease has also been termed calf diphtheria, gangrenous stomatitis,
ulcerative stomatitis, malignant stomatitis, tubercular stomatitis, and
diphtheritic patches of the oral mucous membrane.</p>

<p><em>History</em>.&mdash;During the last few years farmers and cattlemen in this
country, especially in Colorado, Texas, and South Dakota, have increasingly noted
the occurrence of enzootics of "sore mouth" among the young animals of their herds.
Instead of healing, like the usual forms, of themselves, these cases, if untreated,
die. Careful study of some of them has resulted in their identification with cases
reported in 1877 by Dammann, from the shore of the Baltic; in 1878 by Blazekowic,
in Slavonia; in 1879 by Vollers, in Holstein; in 1880 by Lenglen, in France; in 1881
by Macgillivray, in England; and in 1884 by LÃ¶ffler, who isolated and described the
microorganism which produces the disease. Bang obtained this organism from the
diphtheritic lesions of calves in 1890, and Kitt likewise recovered the bacillus
from similar lesions of the larynx and pharynx of calves and pigs in 1893.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Etiology</em>.&mdash;The cause of necrotic stomatitis, as demonstrated
by LÃ¶ffler and since confirmed by other investigators, is <em>Bacillus
necrophorus</em>, often spoken of as the bacillus of necrosis. This organism
varies in form from a coccoid rod to long, wavy filaments, which may reach a
length of 100Âµ; the width varies from 0.75Âµ to 1Âµ. Hence it is described as
polymorphic. It does not stain by Gram, but takes the ordinary anilin dyes,
often presenting, especially the longer forms, a beaded appearance. A
characteristic of the organism, of great moment when we come to treatment,
is that it grows only in the absence of oxygen, from which fact it is
described as an obligate an&aelig;robe.</p>

<p>Very few organisms exhibit a wider range of pathogenesis. According to
clinical observation to the present time, <em>Bacillus necrophorus</em> is pathogenic
for cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, reindeer, kangaroos, antelope, and rabbits.
Experimentally it has been proved pathogenic for rabbits and white mice. The
dog, cat, guinea pig, pigeon, and chicken appear to be absolutely immune. It is
not pathogenic for man.</p>

<p>The importance of this bacillus is far beyond even its relation to necrotic
stomatitis. Besides this disease it has been demonstrated as the causative
factor in foot rot, multiple liver abscesses, disseminated liver necrosis,
embolic necrosis of the lungs, necrosis of the heart, in cattle; gangrenous pox
of the teats, diphtheria of the uterus and vagina, in cows; diphtheritic
inflammation of the small intestine of calves. Among horses it is the agent in
the production of necrotic malanders, quittor, and diphtheritic inflammation of
the large intestine. In hogs it has caused necrotic or diphtheritic processes
in the mucous membrane of the mouth, necrosis of the anterior wall of the nasal
septum, and pulmonary and intestinal necrosis, accompanying hog cholera.
Abscesses of the liver, gangrenous processes of the lips and nose, and
gangrenous affections of the hoof have all been caused in sheep by this
organism.</p>

<p><em>Pathology</em>.&mdash;The principal lesions in necrotic stomatitis occur in the
mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx. The alterations may extend to the
nasal cavities, the larynx, the trachea, the lung, the esophagus, the
intestines, and to the hoof. The oral surfaces affected are, in the order of
frequency, tongue, cheeks, hard palate, gums, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466"
id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>lips, and pharynx. In the majority
of cases the primary infection seems to occur in the tongue. (<a
href="#PLATE_XLIII">Pl. XLIII</a>.)</p>

<p>Infection takes place by inoculation. Some abrasion or break in the
continuity of the mucous membrane of the mouth occurs. Very likely the origin
may be connected with the eruption of the first teeth after birth, or, in
animals somewhat older, the entrance of a sharp-pointed particle of feed.
Gaining an entrance at this point, the bacilli begin to multiply. During their
development they elaborate a toxin, or poisonous substance, which causes the
death, or necrosis, of the epithelial, or superficial, layer of the mucous
membrane and also of the white blood cells which have sallied forth through the
vessel walls to the defense of the tissues against the bacillary attack. This
destruction of the surface epithelium seems to be the essential factor in the
production of the caseous patch, often called the false membrane. From the
connective-tissue framework below is poured forth an inflammatory exudate
highly albuminous or rich in fibrin-forming elements. When this exudate and the
necrosed cellular elements come in contact, the latter furnish a fibrin ferment
which transforms the exduate into a fibrinous mass. This process is known as
coagulation necrosis, and the resulting fibroid mass, containing in its meshes
the necrosed and degenerated epithelium and leucocytes, constitutes the
diphtheritic or false membrane. Did the process cease at this point it would be
properly called a diphtheritic inflammation, but it does not. A caseating
ferment is supplied by the bacilli, and this, acting upon the fibroid patch,
transforms it into a dry, finely granular, yellowish mass of tissue detritus
resembling cheese.</p>

<p>Frequently this caseous inflammation results in the formation of one or more
ulcers with thickened, slightly reddened borders, surmounted by several layers
of this necrosed tissue. The floor of the ulcer is formed by a grayish-yellow,
corroded surface, under which the tissue is transformed into a dry, friable, or
firm cheesy mass. In the tongue this may progress to two fingers' thickness
into the muscular portion; in the cheek it may form an external opening,
permitting fluids to escape from the mouth; upon the palate it frequently
reaches and includes the bone in its destructive course; upon the gums it has
produced necrosis of the tooth sockets, causing loss of the teeth. In the
advanced forms, caseous foci may be seen in the lung and in the liver and
necrotic patches observed on the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal
tract.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Necrotic stomatitis is both a local and a systemic
affection. Primarily it is local. The local lesion is the caseo-necrotic patch
or ulcer developed as a result of the multiplication of the bacilli at the
point of inoculation. The general affection is an intoxication, or poisoning,
of the whole system produced by a soluble toxin elaborated by the bacilli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
The stage of incubation is from three to five days. The first symptoms noted
are a disinclination to take nourishment, some drooling from the mouth, and an
examination of the mouth will show on some portion of its mucous membrane a
circumscribed area of infiltration and redness, possibly an erosion. The latter
gradually extends in size and depth, forming a sharply circumscribed
area of necrotic inflammation. It may measure anywhere from the size of a
5-cent piece to that of a silver dollar or even larger. It has the appearance
of a corroded surface, under which the mucous membrane or muscular tissue seems
transformed into a dry, friable, or firm cheesy mass. It is grayish yellow in
color and is bordered by a zone of thickened tissue slightly reddened and
somewhat granulated. The necrotic tissue is very adherent and can be only
partially peeled off. It is homogeneous, cheesy, and may extend two fingers'
depth into the tissues beneath. The general symptoms are languor, weakness, and
slight fever. In spite of plenty of good feed the calf is seen to be failing.
It stops sucking, or, if older, altogether refuses to eat. The temperature at
this time may be from 104Â° to 107Â° F. The slobber becomes profuse, swallowing
very difficult, opening of the mouth quite painful, and a most offensive odor
is exhaled. The tongue is swollen and its motion greatly impaired. Sometimes
the mouth is kept open, permitting the tumefied tongue to protrude. One or more
of the above symptoms direct the attention to the mouth as the seat of disease;
or, having noticed the debility and disinclination to eat, an examination of
the animal may show a lump under the neck or swelling of the throat or head.
The following extract from a letter is characteristic:</p>

<p>I noticed my calves beginning to fail about the first week in December, but
could not account for it, as they were getting plenty of grain and hay. My
attention was first attracted by a swelling under the neck of one of the
calves. I cast the animal and found that it was feed that had collected and the
animal couldn't swallow it. I removed it, and in so doing noticed a large ulcer
on the tongue and a very offensive odor. This was the first knowledge I had of
anything being wrong with the calves' mouths. They may have been sick for some
time before this.</p>

<p>Out of a herd of 100 belonging to this man, 70 were affected, and the letter
emphasizes the insidious character of the onset.</p>

<p>The general affection at this time manifests itself by dejectedness, extreme
weakness, and emaciation, constant lying down, with stiffness and marked
difficulty in standing.</p>

<p>The disease frequently extends to the nasal cavities, producing a thin,
yellowish, or greenish-yellow, sticky discharge which adheres closely to the
borders of the nostrils. Their edges also show caseous patches similar to those
in the mouth. Sometimes the nasal passage is obstructed by great masses of the
necrosed exudate, thus causing extreme difficulty in breathing. When the
caseous process involves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">
[Pg 468]</a></span>the larynx and trachea there result cough, wheezing,
and dyspnea, together with a yellowish mucopurulent expectoration.</p>

<p>When life is prolonged three or four weeks, caseous foci may be established
in the lung, giving rise to all the signs of a bronchopneumonia. Many of these
cases are associated with a fibrinous pleurisy. The invasion of the
gastrointestinal tract is announced by diarrheal symptoms. This disease
principally attacks sucklings not more than 6 weeks of age, but calves 8 and 10
months old are frequently affected, and several cases in adult cattle have been
reported to this office.</p>

<p>In its very acute form many of the cases run their course in from five to
eight days. In these the local lesions are not strongly marked, and death seems
due to acute intoxication. In other enzootics the majority of the affected
animals live from three to five weeks. These are cases that occasionally
present the pulmonary and intestinal symptoms, and sometimes develop also
caseo-necrotic lesions in the liver.</p>

<p>Ordinarily cases show no tendency to spontaneous cure. Left to themselves
they die. On the contrary, if taken in hand early, the disease is readily
amenable to treatment. In the latter event the prospects of recovery are
excellent.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;Necrotic stomatitis may be differentiated from
foot-and-mouth disease by the fact that in the latter there is a rapid
infection of the entire herd, including the adult cattle, as well as the
infection of hogs and sheep. The characteristic lesion of foot-and-mouth
disease is the appearance of vesicles containing a serous fluid upon the mucous
membrane of the mouth and upon the udder, teats, and feet of the affected
animals. In necrotic stomatitis vesicles are never formed, necrosis occurring
from the beginning and followed by the formation of yellowish, cheesy patches,
principally found in the mouth. Mycotic stomatitis occurs in only a few animals
of the herd, chiefly the adult cattle, and the lesions produced consist of an
inflammation of the mouth and lips and of the skin between the toes, followed
in a few days by small irregular ulcers in the mouth. This disease appears
sporadically, usually in the early fall after a dry summer, does not run a
regular course, and can not be inoculated.</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;Prophylaxis should be carried out along three lines:</p>

<p>(1) Separation of the sick from the healthy animals.</p>

<p>(2) Close scrutiny and thorough disinfection once or twice daily for five
days of the mouths and nasal passages of those animals that have been
exposed.</p>

<p>(3) Complete disinfection of all stalls and sheds.</p>

<p>The disease appears to break out in winter and hold over to spring. It is
conceivable that exposure to cold might so disturb the normal circulation of
the oral tissues as to make the mucous membrane an <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>excellent location for the
causative factor of the disease. There is another possibility, however, which
bears on the third line of prophylaxis. The so-called diphtheritic
inflammations of the vagina and uterus in cows are caused by the same organism that
induces necrotic stomatitis. A European writer has recently pointed out the
almost constant relation of such attacks to previous occurrences of foul foot
or foot rot in the same or other cattle on the place.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, in such cases, the stalls and sheds are the harborers of
this germ. It is possible that many of these outbreaks have some relation to
preceding cases of the above-mentioned diseases and the greater use in winter
of the stalls and sheds, thus harboring the <em>Bacillus necrophorus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The treatment consists almost solely in careful and
extensive cleansing and disinfection of the mouth and other affected surfaces.
The mucous membrane of the mouth should be copiously irrigated with a 4 per
cent solution of boracic acid in warm water at least twice daily. As exposure
to oxygen kills the bacilli, one need have no fear about disturbing or tearing
off the caseous patches or necrotic tissue during irrigation. The irrigation of
the sores should then be followed by the application with a brush or rag on a
stick of a paste made with 1 part of salicylic acid and 10 parts of water, or
the affected areas may be painted with Lugol's solution of iodin (iodin, 1;
potassium iodid, 5; water, 200). Frequent injections of 1 per cent
carbolic-acid solution into the mouth make an excellent treatment. The internal
administration of 2 grams of salicylic acid and 3 grams of chlorate of
potassium three times a day has also proved to be very beneficial when
accompanied with local antiseptic treatment.</p>

<h4>MALIGNANT CATARRH.</h4>

<p>Malignant catarrh, or infectious catarrhal fever, is an acute infectious
disease of cattle preeminently involving the respiratory and digestive tracts,
although the sinuses of the head, the eyes, and the urinary and sexual organs
are very frequently affected. It is relatively rare in this country, being more
common on the continent of Europe. Outbreaks have occurred, however, in
Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey. So far the causal agent of the
disease has never been isolated, and inoculation experiments with the view of
artificially reproducing the disease have proved negative in every case. In
spite of the foregoing statements the consensus of opinion of eminent
investigators points to malignant catarrh as being of specific origin; that is,
due to some form of microorganism the contagious character of which is poorly
developed. This accounts for the slow transmissibility of the disease from one
animal to another. In fact, malignant catarrh is a type of that class of
affections scien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">
[Pg 470]</a></span>tifically known as miasmatic diseases; that is, they remain
stationary in stables with damp floors, low ceilings, poor ventilation, and bad
sanitary conditions in general. Such places furnish a favorable seat of
propagation for the infective material, and it will remain active for a long
time, causing the loss of a few animals each year. One European veterinarian
reports an instance in which the disease remained for 25 years on the same
farm, attacking in all 225 animals, with a mortality of about 98 per cent.</p>

<p>The disease is most common in late winter and early spring, at all
altitudes, and has a special preference for young, well-nourished cattle,
although older animals are not immune. The time between the entrance of the
infective principle into the body of the animal and the appearance of the first
symptoms is relatively very long, averaging, according to German investigators,
from 20 to 30 days. Fortunately, it is not a disease which spreads to any great
extent or which causes severe losses, and hence legislative enactments do not
seem to be necessary for its restriction.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;These are extremely variable according to the point of
localization of the lesions. It is usually ushered in with a chill, followed by
a marked rise of temperature (104Â° to 107Â° F.). The head droops, the skin is
hot and dry, and the coat staring. Quivering of the muscles in various parts of
the body is frequently observed. Marked dullness of the animal, passing,
according to some observers, into an almost stupefied condition later on, is
quite common. The secretion of milk stops in the beginning of the disease, and
loss of flesh, invariably associated with the disease, is extremely marked and
rapid. The lesions of the eyes may best be likened to moon blindness (periodic
ophthalmia) in horses.</p>

<p>There is first an abundant secretion of tears, which run down the face. The
lids are swollen and inflamed, and indeed this may be so marked as to cause
involuntary eversion, exposing the reddened conjunctiva to view. Sunlight is
painful, as is shown by the fact that the animal keeps the eyes continuously
closed. This inflammation may extend to the cornea, causing it to assume a
slightly clouded appearance in mild cases or a chalky whiteness in more severe
affection. Cases of ulceration of the cornea followed by perforation and
subsequent escape of the aqueous humor, leading to shrinking of the eyeball and
permanent loss of sight, have been recorded, but these are relatively rare,
although slight inflammation of the deeper structures of the eye (iris) are
more frequent. In mild cases this inflammation may undergo complete resolution,
but more frequently permanent cloudliness of the cornea, either
diffuse or in spots (leucoma), is the result. The mucous membrane of the mouth,
nose, sinuses of the head, throat, and lower respiratory passages are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>also
involved. It is first catarrhal in character, but soon a false or diphtheritic
membrane is formed, with the production of shallow ulcers. There is dribbling
of saliva from the mouth and discharge from the nose, at first watery, becoming
thicker and mixed with blood and small masses of cast-off croupous membrane,
causing a very fetid odor. These croupous areas when they form in the throat,
larynx, or windpipe, may lead to narrowing of the passages, with consequent
difficult breathing and even suffocation. Various respiratory murmurs may also
be heard, caused by the to-and-fro movement of mucus and inflammatory deposits
along the air passages. There is also inflammation of the horn core with
consequent loosening of the horn shell, and the horns are thus readily knocked
off by the uneasy, blind sufferer. The animal may refuse all feed from the time
of the initial rise of temperature, or in less severe cases, and especially
when the lesions of the digestive tract are not so marked, the appetite may
remain until the disease is well advanced. Constipation is quite common at the
commencement of the attack, followed by diarrhea and severe straining, the
evacuations becoming very soft, fetid, and streaked with blood. Cases of the
evacuation of desquamated patches of diphtheritic membrane from the intestinal
mucosa 6 to 9 feet in length have been reported. The kidneys and bladder are
usually inflamed, the urine being voided with difficulty and the animal
evincing signs of pain. Inflammatory elements, as albumen, casts, etc., may be
seen on examination of the urine. In cows the mucous membrane of the vestibule
is congested, swollen, and may contain ulcers and an excessive quantity of
mucus. Abortion during advanced pregnancy is not infrequent, following a severe
attack. In connection with these various symptoms there may be much uneasiness
on the part of the animal, leading in some cases to madness and furious
delirium, in others to spasms and convulsions or paralysis. A vesicular
eruption of the skin may occur, seen principally between the toes and on the
inside of the flank and in the armpits, with subsequent loss of hair and
epidermis.</p>

<p>Like other infectious diseases, malignant catarrh pursues a longer or
shorter course in accordance with the severity of the attack. In acute cases
death is said to take place three to seven days after the appearance of
symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, may take three or four weeks. According to
statistics, from 50 to 90 per cent of the affected animals die.</p>

<p>If animals which have died of this disease are examined, in addition to the
changes of the mucous membrane of mouth and nasal cavities referred to above,
shallow ulcers in these situations will be found occasionally. These necrotic
processes may pass beneath the mucous membrane and even involve the underlying
bony structure. In severe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">
[Pg 472]</a></span>cases membranous (croupous) deposits are found in the
throat. Similar deposits have been found upon the mucous membrane of
the fourth stomach and intestine, which is always inflamed. There is more or
less inflammation of the membranes of the brain, kidneys, and liver, and some
fatty degeneration of the voluntary muscles. In countries where rinderpest
occasionally appears it may be difficult to distinguish between it and
malignant catarrh, owing to a general similarity of the symptoms. The principal
points to be observed in differentiating between the two are the very slight
transmissibility of the latter as compared with the intense contagiousness of
the former, and the tendency of malignant catarrh to run a more chronic course
than rinderpest, which usually results fatally in a very few days. Only a
trained veterinarian who takes into consideration all the different symptoms
and lesions of both diseases should decide in such cases.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;There is no specific treatment for this affection. Copious
blood letting in the earliest stages has been highly recommended, however, as
this has a tendency to deplete the system and lessen the exudation of
inflammatory products. Antiseptic washes, such as 4 per cent boric-acid
solution to the eyes and Dobell's solution applied to the nose and mouth with
ice poultices over the crest of the head and frontal region, have also proved
efficacious. Calomel should also be given in 1-dram doses twice a day for three
days, and in severe cases, involving the respiratory tract, a powder containing
ferrous sulphate, quinin, and subnitrate of bismuth, given twice a day, will be
found beneficial. At the same time it must be remembered that much greater
success is to be looked for in the preventive treatment. This consists in the
removal of the healthy from the infected animals (not vice versa) and thorough
cleaning and disinfecting of the contaminated stables. If the floors are low
and damp, they should be raised and made dry. If this can not be done, place a
layer of cement under the stable floor to prevent water from entering from
below. The stable should be well ventilated and the soil in the pastures
thoroughly drained. If this is carefully carried out, the contagion should be
destroyed and the danger of the reappearance of the disease in a great measure
lessened.</p>

<h4>MALIGNANT EDEMA.</h4>

<p>Malignant edema, also termed gangrenous septicemia, is an acute,
inflammatory disease of domestic and wild animals, resulting from the
introduction of a specific organism into the deep connective tissues of a
susceptible animal and proving fatal in many instances within 24 to 48 hours.
The disease may be inoculated from one animal to another, but only by inserting
the virus deeply below the skin. It <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473"
id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>is infrequently met with in cattle, but may
follow operating wounds, as roweling, castration, and phlebotomy, which have
become infected with septic matter, soil, or unclean instruments. In the
pathological laboratory of the Bureau of Animal Industry the organism has also
been obtained from the infected muscles of a calf that was supposed to have
died of blackleg, and, as a result, all blackleg virus is thoroughly tested
before it is made into blackleg vaccine in order to exclude the
malignant-edema organism. The essential cause of malignant edema is a long,
slender, motile, spore-bearing bacillus, resembling the bacillus of blackleg,
and which can develop only in the absence of the atmosphere. Unlike the bacilli
of anthrax and blackleg, which are confined to certain districts, this organism
is widely distributed and found in ordinary garden soil, foul water, and in the
normal intestinal tract of the herbivora. It may be brought to the surface of
the soil by growing plants, rains, winds, or burrowing insects and rodents. In
animals that have succumbed to the disease the germ is confined to the seat of
infection, but a few hours after death it may migrate through the blood
channels to other parts of the body. The bacillus may attack man, horses,
asses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, and poultry. Adult cattle, although
refractory to experimental inoculation, suffer from natural infection, while
calves are susceptible to both these methods of exposure. (Kitt.) The
introduction of the bacillus into abrasions of the skin and superficial sores
rarely does any harm, because the germ is quickly destroyed by contact with
air. If, however, the organisms are inserted deeply into the subcutaneous
tissues of susceptible animals, they quickly develop, producing a soluble
poison, which is the fatal agent.</p>

<p>In lamb-shearing season, or after docking or castration, the mortality is
higher among these animals because of wounds inflicted at such times. The
application of antiseptics to wounds thus made will reduce the percentage of
deaths to a minimum.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Usually the first symptoms are overlooked. In the early
stages the animal appears listless, disinclined to move about, and lies down in
shady and quiet places. If forced to move about, the hind legs are drawn
forward with a peculiar, stiff, dragging movement, and there may be slight
muscular trembling over all the body, which becomes more intense as the disease
progresses. When driven, the animal shows signs of fatigue, ultimately dropping
to the ground completely exhausted. Breathing becomes fast and painful, with
frequent spasmodic jerks.</p>

<p>The pulse is quick and weak and the temperature is 106Â° to 107Â° F. An
edematous, doughy, and painful swelling appears at the point of infection. This
tumefaction spreads more and more, and crackles on pressure. In case of an open
wound, a fetid liquid and frothy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474"
id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>discharge is observed. The center of the
swelling may appear soft and jellylike, while the margin is tense, hot, and
painful. The symptoms increase rapidly, resulting in coma and death.</p>

<p><em>Lesions</em>.&mdash;After death the fat and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the
infected area are infiltrated with a yellow gelatinous material containing an
orange-colored foam, due to the presence of gas bubbles.</p>

<p>The muscles at this point are friable, spongy, and of a uniform brownish
tint, dissociated by gas and with a blood-tinged exudate. This gangrenous
tissue, when present before death, can be removed without pain to the animal.
The intestines are generally normal, but, together with the peritoneum, they
may be inflamed, and the lungs are usually the seat of an edema. The spleen,
liver, and kidneys retain their normal appearance, in marked contrast with
anthrax.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;Unlike blackleg, this disease never appears as
an epizootic but in isolated cases. It may also be differentiated from the
former by the history of a recent parturition or surgical operation, by the
presence of an external injury at the site of the swelling accompanied with a
fetid liquid discharge, and the gangrenous appearance of the tumefaction. Man
is susceptible to malignant edema, but not to blackleg. Malignant edema may
also be easily differentiated from anthrax in that the blood and spleen are
normal in appearance, while in the latter disease the blood is dark and of a
tarlike consistency, and the spleen appears swollen, injected, and softened.
The local tumor in malignant edema contains gas bubbles, which are absent in
anthrax swellings. Inoculation experiments of guinea pigs, rabbits, and
chickens will also disclose the differences among the above-mentioned three
diseases, since all these species are killed by the germ of malignant edema,
only the first two species by the anthrax bacillus, while the guinea pig alone
will succumb to the blackleg infection.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment is chiefly surgical and consists in laying the
infected areas wide open by free incision, followed by a liberal application of
a 30 per cent solution of hydrogen dioxid and subsequently a 5 per cent
solution of carbolic acid. Usually the disease when observed has advanced to
such an extent that medicinal interference is without avail. Preventive
treatment is by far the most desirable, and consists, essentially, in a
thorough disinfection of all accidental and surgical wounds, the cleansing of
the skin, and the exclusion of soil, filth, and bacteria during surgical
operations of any nature. Sheds, barns, and stables should receive a thorough
application of quicklime or crude carbolic acid wash after all rubbish has been
removed and burned. All dead animals should be burned or deeply buried and
covered well with quicklime.</p>

<h4>SOUTHERN CATTLE FEVER (TEXAS FEVER, TICK FEVER).</h4>

<h5>[<a href="#PLATE_XLIV">Pls.&nbsp;XLIV</a>-<a href="#PLATE_XLIX">XLIX</a>.]</h5>

<p>This disease, which is more commonly known as Texas fever, and sometimes as
splenetic fever, is a specific fever communicated by cattle which have recently
been moved northward from the infected district; it is also contracted by
cattle taken into the infected district from other parts of the world. It is
characterized by the peculiarity among animal diseases that the animals which
disseminate the infection are apparently in good health, while those which
sicken and die from it do not, as a rule, infect others.</p>

<p>It is accompanied with high fever, greatly enlarged spleen, destruction of
the red blood corpuscles, escape of the coloring matter of the blood through
the kidneys, giving the urine a deep-red color, with a yellowness of the mucous
membranes and fat, which is seen more especially in fat cattle, by a rapid loss
of strength, and with fatal results in a large proportion of cases.</p>

<p>This disease has various names in different sections of the country where it
frequently appears. It is often called Spanish fever, acclimation fever, red
water, black water, distemper, murrain, dry murrain, yellow murrain, bloody
murrain, Australian tick fever, and tristeza of South America.</p>

<p>The earliest accounts we have of this disease date back to 1814, when it was
stated by Dr. James Mease, before the Philadelphia Society for Promoting
Agriculture, that the cattle from a certain district in South Carolina so
certainly disease all others with which they mix in their progress to the North
that they are prohibited by the people of Virginia from passing through the
State; that these cattle infect others while they themselves are in perfect
health, and that cattle from Europe or the interior taken to the vicinity of
the sea are attacked by a disease that generally proves fatal. Similar
observations have been made in regard to a district in the southern part of the
United States.</p>

<p>The northern limits of this area are changed yearly as a result of the
dissemination or eradication of the cattle tick along the border, but the
infected area has gradually decreased, owing to the successful endeavors pushed
forward to eliminate the ticks.</p>

<p>It was the frequent and severe losses following the driving of cattle from
the infected district in Texas into and across the Western States and
Territories which led to the disease being denominated Texas fever. It is now
known, however, that the infection is not peculiar to Texas or even to the
United States, but that it also exists in southern Europe, Central and South
America, Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
When cattle from other sections of the country are taken into the infected
district they contract this disease usually during the first summer, and if
they are adult animals, particularly milch cows or fat cattle, nearly all die.
Calves are much more likely to survive. The disease is one from which immunity
is acquired, and therefore calves which recover are not again attacked, as a
rule, even after they become adult.</p>

<p>When the infection is disseminated beyond the permanently infected district,
the roads, pastures, pens, and other inclosures are dangerous for susceptible
animals until freezing weather. The infection then disappears, and cattle may
be driven over the grounds or kept in the inclosures the succeeding summer and
the disease will not reappear. There are some exceptions to this rule in the
section just north of the boundary line of the infected district. In this
locality the infection sometimes resists the winters, especially if they are
mild.</p>

<p>In regard to the manner in which the disease is communicated, experience
shows that this does not occur by animals coming near or in contact with one
another. It is an indirect infection. The cattle from the infected district
first infect the pastures, roads, pens, cars, etc., whence the susceptible
cattle obtain the virus secondhand. Usually animals do not contract the disease
when separated from infected pastures by a fence. If, however, there is any
drainage or washing by rains across the line of fence this rule does not hold
good.</p>

<p>The investigations made by the Bureau of Animal Industry demonstrate that
the ticks which adhere to cattle from the infected district are the only known
means of conveying the infection to susceptible cattle. The infection is not
spread by the saliva, the urine, or the manure of cattle from the infected
district. In studying the causation and prevention of this disease, attention
must therefore be largely given to the tick, and it now seems apparent that if
cattle could be freed from this parasite when leaving the infected district
they would not be able to spread the malady. The discovery of the connection of
the ticks with the production of the disease has played a very important part
in determining the methods that should be adopted in preventing its spread. It
established an essential point and indicated many lines of investigation which
have yielded and are still likely to yield very important results.</p>

<p><em>Nature of the disease</em>.&mdash;Texas fever is caused by an organism which
lives within the red blood corpuscles and breaks them up. It is therefore
simply a blood disease. The organism does not belong to the bacteria but to the
protozoa. It is not, in other words, a microscopic plant, but it belongs to the
lowest forms of the animal kingdom. This very minute organism multiplies very
rapidly in the body of the infected animal, and in acute cases causes an
enormous destruction <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">
[Pg 477]</a></span>of red corpuscles in a few days. How it gets into the red
corpuscle it is not possible to state, but it appears that it enters as an
exceedingly minute body, probably endowed with motion, and only after it has
succeeded in entering the corpuscle does it begin to enlarge. Plate XLV, figure
4, illustrates an early stage of this blood parasite. The red corpuscle
contains a very minute, roundish body which is stained blue to bring it into
view. The body is, as a rule, situated near the edge of the corpuscle. Figure 5
illustrates an older stage in the growth of the parasite, in fact the largest
which has thus far been detected. It will be noticed that there are usually two
bodies in a corpuscle. These bodies are in general pear-shaped. The narrow ends
are always toward each other when two are present in the same corpuscle. If we
bear in mind that the average diameter of the red blood corpuscles of cattle is
from 1/4000 to 1/5000 inch, the size of the contained parasite may be at once
appreciated by a glance at the figures referred to.</p>

<p>The various disease processes which go on in Texas fever, and which we may
observe by examining the organs after death, all result from the destruction of
the red corpuscles; this destruction may be extremely rapid or slow. When it is
rapid we have the acute, usually fatal, type of Texas fever, which is always
witnessed in the height of the Texas-fever season, that is, during the latter
weeks of August and the early weeks of September. When the destruction of
corpuscles is slower, a mild, usually nonfatal, type of the disease is called
forth, which is only witnessed late in autumn or more rarely in July and the
early part of August. Cases of the mild type occurring thus early usually
become acute later and terminate fatally.</p>

<p>The acute disease is fatal in most cases, and the fatality is due not so
much to the loss of blood corpuscles as to the difficulty which the organs
have in getting rid of the waste products arising from this wholesale destruction.
How great this may be a simple calculation will serve to illustrate. In a steer
weighing 1,000 pounds, the blood in its body weighs about 50 pounds, if we
assume that the blood represents one-twentieth of the weight of the body, which
is a rather low estimate. According to experimental determination at
the bureau station, which consists in counting the number of blood corpuscles
in a given quantity of blood from day to day in such an animal, the corpuscles
contained in from 5 to 10 pounds of blood may be destroyed within 24 hours. The
remains of these corpuscles and the coloring matter in them must be either
converted into bile or excreted unchanged. The result of this effort on the
part of the liver causes extensive disease of this organ. The bile secreted by
the liver cells contains so much solid material that it stagnates in the finest
bile canals and chokes these up completely. This in turn interferes with the
nutrition of the liver cells and they undergo fatty de<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>generation and perish.
The functions of the liver are thereby completely suspended and death is the
result. This enormous destruction of corpuscles takes place to a large extent
in the kidneys, where a great number of corpuscles containing the parasites
are always found in acute cases. This accounts largely for the blood-colored
urine, or red water, which is such a characteristic feature of Texas fever.
The corpuscles themselves are not found in the urine; it is the red coloring
matter, or hemoglobin, which leaves them when they break up and pass into
the urine.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;After a period of exposure to infected soil, which may vary
from 13 to 90 days, and which will be more fully discussed under the subject of
cattle ticks as bearers of the Texas-fever parasite, the disease first shows
itself in dullness, loss of appetite, and a tendency to leave the herd and
stand or lie down alone. A few days before these symptoms appear the presence
of a high fever may be detected by the clinical thermometer. The temperature
rises from a normal of 101Â° to 103Â° F. to 106Â° and 107Â° F. There seems to be
little or no change in temperature until recovery or death ensues. The period
of high temperature or fever varies considerably. As it indicates the intensity
of the disease process going on within, the higher it is the more rapid the
fatal end. When it does not rise above 104Â° F. the disease is milder and more
prolonged.</p>

<p>The bowels are mostly constipated during the fever; toward the end the feces
may become softer and rather deeply tinged with bile. The urine shows nothing
abnormal during the course of the disease until near the fatal termination,
when it may be deeply stained with the coloring matter of the blood.
(Hemoglobinuria; see <a href="#PLATE_XLV">Pl. XLV</a>, fig. 3.) Although this
symptom is occasionally observed in animals which recover, yet it may generally
be regarded as an indication of approaching death. The pulse and respiration
are usually much more rapid than during health.</p>

<p>Other symptoms in addition to those mentioned have been described by
observers, but they do not seem to be constant, and only those described above
are nearly always present. As the end approaches emaciation becomes very
marked, the blood is very thin and watery, and the closing of any wound of the
skin by clots is retarded. The animal manifests increasing stupor and may lie
down much of the time. Signs of delirium have been observed in some cases.
Death occurs most frequently in the night.</p>

<p>The duration of the disease is very variable. Death may ensue in from three
days to several weeks after the beginning of the fever. Those that recover
ultimately do so very slowly, owing to the great poverty of the blood in red
corpuscles. The flesh is regained but very gradually, and the animal may be
subjected to a second, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">
[Pg 479]</a></span>though mild, attack later on in the autumn, which pushes
the full recovery onward to the beginning of winter.</p>

<p>In the mild type of the disease, which occurs in October and November,
symptoms of disease are well-nigh absent. There is little if any fever, and if
it were not for loss of flesh and more or less dullness the disease may pass
unnoticed, as it undoubtedly does in a majority of cases. If, however,
the blood corpuscles are counted from time to time a gradually diminishing
number will be found, and after several weeks only about one-fifth or one-sixth
of the normal number are present. It is indeed surprising how little impression
upon the animal this very impoverished condition of the blood appears to make.
It is probable, however, that if two animals kept under the same conditions,
one healthy and the other at the end of one of these mild attacks, are weighed,
the difference would be plainly shown.</p>

<p><em>Pathological changes observable after death</em>.&mdash;In the preceding pages
some of these have already been referred to in describing the nature of the
disease. It is very important at times to determine whether a certain disease
is Texas fever or some other disease, like anthrax, for example. This fact can,
as a rule, be determined at once by a thorough microscopic examination of the
blood. The necessary apparatus and the requisite qualifications for this task
leave this method entirely in the hands of experts. There are, however, a
considerable number of changes caused by this disease which may be detected by
the naked eye when the body has been opened. Put together they make a mistake
quite impossible. The presence of small ticks on the skin of the escutcheon,
the thighs, and the udder is a very important sign in herds north of the
Texas-fever line, as it indicates that they have been brought in some manner
from the South and have carried the disease with them, as will be explained
later. Another very important sign is the thin, watery condition of the blood,
either just before death or when the fever has been present for four or five
days. A little incision into the skin will enable any one to determine this
point. Frequently the skin is so poor in blood that it may require several
incisions to draw a drop or more.</p>

<p>The changes in the internal organs, as found on post-mortem examinations,
are briefly as follows: The spleen, or milt, is much larger than in healthy
animals. It may weigh three or four times as much. When it is incised the
contents or pulp is blackish (see <a href="#PLATE_XLIV">Pl. XLIV</a>, fig. 1),
and may even well out as a disintegrated mass. The markings of the healthy
spleen (fig. 2) are all effaced by the enormous number of blood corpuscles
which have collected in it, and to which the enlargement is attributable. Next
to the spleen the liver will arouse our attention. (See <a href="#PLATE_XLV">
Pl. XLV</a>, fig. 2.) It is larger than <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>in the healthy state,
has lost its natural brownish color (fig. 1), and now has on the surface a
paler, yellowish hue. When it is incised this yellowish tinge, or mahogany
color, as it has been called by some, is still more prominent. This is owing to
the large quantity of bile in the finest bile capillaries, and as these are not
uniformly filled with it the cut surface has a more or less mottled appearance.
This bile injection causes in many cases a fatty degeneration of the liver
cells, which makes the organ appear still lighter in color.</p>

<p>In all cases the gall bladder should be examined. This is distended with
bile, which holds in suspension a large number of yellow flakes, so that when
it is poured into a tall bottle to settle fully one-half or more of the column
of fluid will be occupied by a layer of flakes. If mucus is present at the same
time, the bile may become so viscid that when it is poured from one glass
to another it forms long bands. The bile in health is a limpid fluid,
containing no solid particles.</p>

<p>If the animal during life has not been observed to pass urine colored with
blood or red water, the bladder should be opened. This quite invariably, in
acute cases, contains urine which varies in color from a deep port wine to a
light claret. In many cases the color is so dense that light will not pass
through even a thin layer. (<a href="#PLATE_XLV">Pl. XLV</a>, fig. 3.) The
kidneys are always found congested in the acute attack. The disease exerts but
little effect on the stomach and intestines beyond more or less reddening of
the mucous membrane; hence an examination of them may be safely omitted. The
lungs are, as a rule, not diseased. The heart usually shows patches of blood
extravasation on the inside (left ventricle) and less markedly on the outer
surface.</p>

<p>We have observed jaundice of the various tissues but very rarely. It has
been observed by some quite regularly, however.</p>

<p>During the hot season about 90 per cent of the susceptible mature animals
from a noninfected district die, but later, in the cool weather, the disease
assumes a milder type, with a consequent decrease in the number of deaths.</p>

<p>The cattle tick, <em>Margaropus annulatus</em>, as the carrier of Texas fever.
(<a href="#PLATE_XLVI">Pls.&nbsp;XLVI</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#PLATE_XLVII">XLVII</a>,&nbsp; and <a href="#PLATE_XLVIII">XLVIII</a>.)
&mdash;The cattle tick is, as its name indicates, a parasite of cattle in the
southern part of the United States. It belongs to the group of Arthropoda and
to the genus <em>Margaropus</em> (or <em>Boophilus</em>), which is included in
the order Acarina. Its life history is quite simple and easily traced from one
generation to another. It is essentially a parasite, attaching itself to the
skin (<a href="#PLATE_XLVIII">Pl. XLVIII</a>) and drawing the blood of its host.
It is unable to come to maturity and reproduce its kind unless it becomes
attached to the skin of cattle, whence it may obtain its food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
The eggs laid on the ground after the female has dropped from the host begin
to develop at once. When the embryo is fully formed within the shell it
ruptures this and gains its freedom. The time required from the laying of the
eggs to their hatching varies considerably, according to the temperature. In
the laboratory in the heat of midsummer this was accomplished in about 13 days.
In the late fall, under the same conditions, it required from four to six
weeks. The larva after emerging from the egg is very minute, six-legged, and is
just visible to the naked eye. (<a href="#PLATE_XLVI">Pl. XLVI</a>, fig. 3.) If
these larvÃ¦ are kept on a layer of moist sand or earth in a covered dish, they
may remain alive for months, but there is no appreciable increase in size. So
soon, however, as they are placed upon cattle growth begins.</p>

<p>On pastures these little creatures soon find their way on to cattle. They
attach themselves by preference to the tender skin on the escutcheon, the
inside of the thighs, and on the base of the udder. Yet when they are very
numerous they may be found in small numbers on various parts of the body, such
as the neck, the chest, and the ears. (<a href="#PLATE_XLVIII">Pl. XLVIII</a>
and <a href="#PLATE_XLIX">Pl. XLIX</a>, fig. 1.)</p>

<p>The changes which they undergo during their parasitic existence were first
studied by Dr. Cooper Curtice, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, in 1889. The
young tick molts within a week, and the second or nymphal stage of the
parasite's life is thus ushered in. After this change it has four pairs of
legs. Within another week another molt takes place by which the tick passes
from the nymphal to the sexual, or adult, stage. Impregnation now takes place,
and, with the development of the ova in the body, the tick takes an increased
quantity of blood, so that in a few days it becomes very much larger. That the
rapid growth is due to the blood taken in may be easily proved by crushing one.
The intestine is distended with a thick, tarry mass composed of partly digested
blood. When the female has reached a certain stage of maturity she drops to the
ground and begins to lay a large number of eggs, which hatch in the time given
above.</p>

<p>The life of the cattle tick is thus spent largely on cattle, and although
the young, or larvÃ¦ may live for a long time on the ground in the summer
season, they can not mature except as parasites on cattle and horses. We have
purposely omitted various details of the life history, including that of the
male, as they are not necessary to an understanding of our present
subject&mdash;Texas fever. How this is transmitted we will proceed to consider.
Before the enforcement of the Federal quarantine southern cattle sent north
during the spring and summer months carried on their bodies large numbers of
the cattle ticks, which, when matured, would drop off and lay their <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>eggs in the
northern pastures. After hatching, the young ticks would soon get upon any
northern cattle which happened to be on the pasture. So soon as they attached
themselves to the skin they inoculated the cattle, and Texas fever would break
out a week or more thereafter. For many years there had been a growing
suspicion that the cattle tick was in some way concerned in the spread of Texas
fever, and the facts which supported this supposition finally became so
numerous and convincing that a series of experiments was inaugurated by the
Bureau of Animal Industry which served to show that the tick is abundantly able
to carry the disease to a herd of healthy cattle, and, in fact, is probably the
only agent concerned in the transmission of the disease from southern cattle to
susceptible northern animals.</p>

<p><em>Injurious effects of cattle ticks</em>.&mdash;Unfortunately many cattle owners
who have always been accustomed to see both ticks and ticky cattle on their
farms are not inclined to attach much importance to these parasites, and, as a
rule, through lack of appreciation of their damaging effects, placidly consider
them as of little consequence. That ticks may be detrimental to their hosts in
several ways has probably not suggested itself to these stockmen, who are most
vitally affected, and it therefore seems necessary to emphasize the fact that,
in addition to their relation to Texas fever, they may also be injurious to
cattle as external parasites. While the power of transmitting Texas fever is
undoubtedly the most dangerous property possessed by the cattle tick and is the
principal cause for adopting stringent measures looking to its
complete eradication, nevertheless there still remain other good reasons for
the accomplishment of this achievement. These secondary objections to the
presence of ticks on cattle consists in the physical harm they do to the host
aside from the production of the specific disease of Texas fever. True, a few
parasites may remain on cattle indefinitely without causing any noticeable
effect, but it is not uncommon to notice bovine animals on pastures with their
hides heavily infested with these pests. In such cases it can readily be seen
that the continuous sucking of blood causes more or less impoverishment of the
circulation. The animal must therefore be fed more in order to meet the demands
of the parasites in addition to the ordinary needs of the host. If the ticks
are removed from the body, the bites inflicted are often distinguished by
small, inflamed or reddened areas somewhat swollen, with perforations of the
skin which may allow the entrance of various kinds of disease germs, and
showing that more or less irritation of the hide is produced by these
parasites. This condition, together with the loss of blood, frequently induces
an irritable state and evidence of uneasiness commonly known as "tick worry,"
which results in the loss of energy and other derangements of the animal's
health. It may in some cases, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">
[Pg 483]</a></span>especially in hot weather, become so pronounced
that the animal will lose flesh in spite of good pasturing, thereby reducing
the vitality and rendering it more susceptible to the inroads of disease.
Moreover, if the infestation of ticks is not controlled, the cattle may be so
reduced in condition that growth is retarded, and, in the case of young
animals, they may never become fully developed, but remain thin, weak, and
stunted&mdash;a condition that has been termed "tick poverty"&mdash;and easily
succumb to other diseases as a result of lowered vitality. In milch cows this
debilitating influence of the numerous ticks is shown in a greatly reduced milk
supply. This should not appear strange when it is considered that some animals
harbor several thousand of the bloodsucking parasites. If these parasites are
crushed, it will be found that their intestines are completely filled with a
dark, thick mass of blood abstracted from the animal host and containing
nutriment that should go to the formation of milk, flesh, and the laying on of
fat. In some rare cases the large number of bites on a limited area of skin may
be followed by infection with pus-producing organisms, giving rise to small
abscesses which may terminate in ulcers. The discharge from these sores, or in
some cases the mere oozing of blood serum through the incision made by the
mouth parts of the ticks, keeps the hair moist and matted together, and the
laying and hatching of fly eggs in these areas give rise to infestation with
destructive maggots, causing ulcers and other complications that require
medical treatment. These statements regarding the secondary injurious effects
of cattle ticks also apply to those ticks which have been previously spoken of
as harmless so far as Texas fever is concerned, and, in fact, to all external
parasites. Therefore, it is just as important to eradicate the cattle ticks for
reasons other than those associated with Texas fever as it is to exterminate
lice, fleas, and other vermin. Furthermore, cattle ticks, aside from the losses
sustained by their purely parasitic effects, are the greatest menace to the
profitable raising and feeding of cattle in the South, because they are an
obstacle to cattle traffic between the infected and noninfected districts.</p>

<p><em>Loss occasioned by cattle ticks</em>.&mdash;The economic aspect of the tick
problem is unquestionably of the greatest practical interest, since the
fundamental importance of all the other questions which surround it depends
upon the actual money value involved. A careful and conservative estimate made
in 1916 placed the annual loss caused by the ticks in the United States at
$40,000,000, and indicated that the ticks also lowered the assets of the South
by an additional $33,000,000. The principal items in these losses are set forth
below.</p>

<p>It is well known that those animals coming from an infected district and
sold in the "southern pens" of northern stockyards bring about one-half a cent
less per pound than the quoted market price. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484"
id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>The handicap that is placed on the southern
cattle raiser as a result of this decrease in value of his stock will average
at this figure $3 per head, allowing an individual weight of 600 pounds for
all classes of animals. This decreased value reacts and fixes the valuation
of all cattle which remain in the infected territory, thereby reducing the
assets of the cattle industry of that section. In addition there is a very
great loss from the decrease in flesh and lack of development of southern
cattle occasioned by the parasitic life of the ticks from without and by the
blood-destroying and enervating properties of the protozoan parasites from
within.</p>

<p>The presence of the tick among the cattle of the South not only lessens the
value of the cattle on the hoof but causes the gradings of hides that have been
infested with ticks as No. 4 quality. The same hide, if free from tick marks,
would grade No. 2. The difference in price between these two grades of hides is
3 cents a pound. As the hide of a southern steer weighs about 42 pounds, the
presence of the tick in the hide causes a loss in the hide alone of more than
$1.26 a hide. It has been shown that the cost of tick eradication is only about
50 cents a head, so that if the counties make a systematic campaign to
eradicate the tick, the increase in value of the hide alone would pay for the
cost of tick eradication and leave the farmer a net profit of about 76 cents a
hide.</p>

<p>The shrinkage in the milk production of cattle harboring many ticks will
average 1 quart a day, which in the aggregate is a heavy loss. The damage
resulting to the southern purchaser of northern purebred or high-grade cattle
is another item of no small moment. About 10 per cent of all such cattle taken
into the South die of Texas fever, even after they are immunized by blood
inoculations, and about 60 per cent of them succumb to Texas fever when not so
treated. As they are usually very expensive animals and of a highly valued
strain of blood, the loss in certain cases is excessive and in others almost
irreparable, owing to the possible extinction of some particular type
especially selected for the improvement of the herd.</p>

<p>Another instance in which it is difficult to figure the injury done by the
ticks is in the case of death of nonimmune cattle in the tick-free
pastures of the South. Such animals are as susceptible to Texas fever as
nonimmune northern cattle, and inasmuch as there is in many States only one out
of every four farms infested with ticks, the cattle on the remaining farms will
in many cases contract Texas fever when exposed to the fever tick. These losses
can scarcely be computed, as the death rate depends so much on the season of
the year when exposure occurs and on the age of the animal affected. However,
the deaths among such cattle are considerable, although this fact is little
appreciated or understood by many outside the infected area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
On rare occasions a small outbreak of Texas fever occurs north of the quarantine
line as a result of improperly disinfected cars, of unscrupulous dealers
breaking the quarantine regulations, or of some accidental condition. Such
damage, however, is slight, but should be considered in summing up the loss
occasioned by the fever tick.</p>

<p>The advertisement which a breeder obtains and the sales which are made by
having his stock in the show ring are usually lost to the cattle raiser in the
infected area who aspires to display his animals in the North, as they are
barred from most of these exhibitions. On the other hand, the southern farmer
is not given an opportunity to see and be stimulated by the fine specimens of
northern cattle which might be shown at southern stock exhibits, for the reason
that the danger of contracting Texas fever is too patent to warrant such
exposure. A heavy expense is incurred by the Government and the States in
enforcing the regulations that apply to the quarantine line.</p>

<p>Another loss which is indirectly sustained by the southern cattle industry
through increased freight rates is the cost, to the railroad companies, of
cleaning and disinfecting the cars that carry cattle and in providing separate
pens for them at various places.</p>

<p>These statements are sufficient to indicate that the loss to the quarantined
section from the cattle tick is something enormous. Such a series of
encumbrances as those recorded could be carried by the cattle industry of no
other section of the country than the South, whose excellent pastures, rich
soil, and salubrious climate are the only reasons for its ability to overcome
such obstacles in meeting the competition of the West; and it is the inherent
capacity of the South for greatly increasing its herds and enlarging its
pasture lands that makes the actual loss even secondary to the potential loss
from restrictions necessitated by the presence of the cattle tick. This
potential loss may be described as the difference between the value of the
cattle industry of the South to-day and the extent to which this industry would
be increased if farmers and ranchmen were assured that their lands and cattle
would not become infested with fever ticks. Could this assurance be given, the
beneficial effects would extend over the entire country, because the market of
the northern breeder would thereby become greatly extended.</p>

<p>These appalling losses and annual sacrifices of the cattle raisers of the
infected district can be entirely effaced, and this at a small proportionate
cost; for, with enthusiastic stockmen, satisfactory State legislation,
sufficient money, and a corps of trained inspectors, the cattle tick may be
exterminated, and every dollar expended in this work will be returned many
times during each succeeding year.</p>

<p><em>The so-called period of incubation</em>.&mdash;After the young ticks have
attached themselves to cattle the fever appears about 10 days there<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>after in midsummer. When
the weather is cool, as in autumn, this period may be a little longer. The
actual period of incubation may be shorter, for if blood from a case of Texas
fever is injected into the blood vessels of healthy cattle the fever may
appear within five days. When cattle graze upon pastures over which southern
cattle have passed, the time when the disease appears varies within wide limits.
When the animals have been put upon pastures immediately after southern cattle
have infected them with ticks, it may take from 30 to 60 days, or even longer,
before the disease appears. This will be readily understood when we recall the
life history of ticks. The southern cattle leave only matured ticks which have
dropped from them. These must lay their eggs and the latter must be hatched
before any ticks can get upon native cattle. The shortest period is thus not
less than 30 days if we include 10 days for the period of incubation after
the young ticks have attached themselves to native cattle. When the infection
of pastures with ticks has taken place early in the season, or when it is
cold, the period is much longer, because it takes longer for the eggs to
hatch.</p>

<p>If native cattle are placed upon pastures which have been infected with
ticks some time before, the disease will appear so much sooner, because the
young ticks may be already hatched and attack the cattle at once. It will be
evident, therefore, that the length of time between the exposure of native
cattle on infected fields and the appearance of the disease depends on the date
of original infection, and on the weather, whether cold or hot. When native
cattle are placed upon fields on which young ticks are already present, they
will show the fever in 13 to 15 days if the season is hot.</p>

<p>The fever appears before the ticks have matured. In fact, they are still
small enough to be overlooked. In any case very careful search should be made
for them in those places which they prefer&mdash;the thighs, escutcheon, and
udder. After the acute stage of the fever has passed the ticks begin to swell
up and show very plainly. (<a href="#PLATE_XLVI">Pl. XLVI</a>, figs. 6 and
7.)</p>

<p><em>Prevention</em>.&mdash;It is generally accepted that if southern cattle are
entirely free from that species of tick known as <em>Margaropus annulatus</em> they can
be allowed to mingle with the most susceptible animals without danger.
Furthermore, it has been learned from the study of the life history of the
cattle tick and by observation that this tick infests pastures only
transiently, never permanently, and will not mature except upon cattle or
equines, that its extermination is possible, and that the disease it causes may
be prevented. Therefore the various methods with these results in view should
be directed toward the destruction of ticks on cattle as well as their
eradication from the pastures.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
</p>

<h4>METHODS OF ERADICATING THE TICKS.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h4>

<p>In undertaking measures for eradicating the tick it is evident that the pest
may be attacked in two locations, namely, on the pasture and on the cattle.</p>

<p>In freeing pastures the method followed may be either a direct or an
indirect one. The former consists in excluding all cattle, horses, and mules
from pastures until all the ticks have died from starvation. The latter
consists in permitting the cattle and other animals to continue on the infested
pasture and treating them at regular intervals with agents destructive to ticks
and thus preventing engorged females from dropping and reinfesting the pasture.
The larvÃ¦ on the pasture, or those which hatch from eggs laid by females
already there, will all eventually meet death. Such of these as get upon the
cattle from time to time will be destroyed by the treatment, while those which
fail to find a host will starve in the pasture.</p>

<p>Animals may be freed of ticks in two ways. They may be treated with an agent
that will destroy all the ticks present, or they may be rotated at proper
intervals on tick-free fields until all the ticks have dropped. The method most
generally used is dipping the cattle in a solution of arsenic. The
pasture-rotation method is not only more complicated, but the necessary
tick-free fields are seldom available.</p>

<h5>DIPPING.</h5>

<p>The dipping vat is the best and cheapest means of applying the
tick-destroying solution. The great advantage of dipping over spraying and
applying remedies by hand lies in the fact that thoroughness of the treatment
is practically assured.</p>

<p>When eradication is undertaken, all the cattle, and also the horses and
mules if they harbor ticks, are treated regularly every two weeks during the
part of the year that the temperature is favorable to treatment, until the
ticks have disappeared. The purpose of the treatment is to destroy all ticks
that get on the animals before they have had a chance to mature and drop, thus
preventing them from reinfesting the pasture, farm, or range. If the treatment
used were absolutely effective in destroying each and every tick on the animals
treated there would be no renewal of the infestation after the treatment is
begun. The cattle would act simply as collectors of ticks which would be
destroyed regularly by the treatment applied every two weeks. It is probable,
however, that in most instances, either because of the lack of efficiency of
the dip or imperfect application, or because of failure to dip all cattle
systematically, some ticks escape <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488"
id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>treatment and reproduce, thus prolonging
the time that otherwise would be required for eradication.</p>

<p>If ticks apparently disappear from the cattle after they have been under
treatment for some time, the dipping should not be discontinued until a number
of careful inspections show that the cattle are free of ticks. If ticks
continue on cattle until cold weather and then finally disappear it should be
borne in mind that in all probability eradication has not been accomplished and
that there may be engorged females, unhatched eggs, and inactive seed ticks on
the farm or range, and that even if the cattle should remain free of ticks
during the winter they may become reinfested the following spring. In any case
in which ticks disappear from the cattle and treatment is discontinued, the
cattle should be watched very carefully for ticks until ample time has elapsed
to leave no doubt that eradication has been accomplished.</p>

<p>As a general rule it has been found that if dipping is begun in March and
systematically and thoroughly done, all cattle being dipped every 14 days until
November, complete eradication will be secured. In dipping, each animal should
be completely covered by the dip. To prevent any animals from going through the
vat without becoming wet all over, a man, provided with a forked stick, should
be stationed at the middle of the vat to shove under those that have not been
completely submerged.</p>

<p>Dipping is the only really satisfactory method of treating animals for
ticks. In cases of emergency, however, or where there are not cattle enough
within a radius of several miles to warrant the construction of a vat in which
all the cattle of the community may be dipped, spraying may be advisable. In
spraying animals the work should be done with great thoroughness and every
portion of the body treated. An animal can not be sprayed properly unless it is
tied or otherwise held, nor can good results be obtained unless the hair and
skin are thoroughly wetted.</p>

<p><em>Preparation and use of arsenical dips</em>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8"
id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;After experimenting for many years to discover a
practical method for dipping cattle to destroy ticks without injury to the
cattle, the Bureau of Animal Industry has developed a very satisfactory
arsenical dip. Two formulas are given for homemade dips, one known as the "S-B"
(self-boiled) and the other as the boiled dip. The former is the one usually
employed.</p>

<p><em>The S-B dip</em>.&mdash;The formula calls for two stock solutions, arsenic stock
and tar stock, which must not be mixed except in the diluted dipping bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
Arsenic stock requires the following materials ready to hand before starting:</p>

<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
    <tr>
      <td class="left"></td>
      <td class="left">Pounds.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Caustic soda</td>
      <td class="right">4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">White arsenic</td>
      <td class="right">10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Sal-soda crystals</td>
      <td class="right">10</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>There should be also some means for heating the solution in case, as
sometimes happens because of impure materials, lack of skill, or some
unforeseen circumstance, the heat created by mixing the materials should be
insufficient to dissolve all the arsenic.</p>

<p>In a 5-gallon kettle or metal<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> pail place the 4 pounds of
caustic soda, add 1 gallon of cold water, and stir with a stick until the
caustic soda is practically all dissolved. Without delay begin adding the white
arsenic, in portions of a pound or two at a time, as fast as it can be
dissolved without causing the solution to boil, stirring all the time. If the
liquid begins to boil, stop stirring and let it cool slightly before adding
more arsenic. The secret of success is to work the arsenic in fast enough to
keep the solution very hot&mdash;nearly but not quite at the boiling point. The
result should be a clear solution, except for dirt. If the liquid persistently
remains muddy or milky, it may be because the operation has been conducted so
fast that much water has been boiled out and sodium arsenite is beginning to
crystallize, so add another gallon of water and stir. If the solution does not
then clear up, the caustic soda must have been very low grade, and the
undissolved substance must be arsenic. In that case, put the kettle over the
fire, heat nearly, but not quite, to boiling, and stir. As soon as the solution
of arsenic is complete, dilute to about 4 gallons, add the sodium carbonate,
and stir until dissolved.</p>

<p><em>Cautions</em>.&mdash;It is necessary to avoid splashing. Hence never work
hurriedly; stir deliberately and regularly; do not dump in the arsenic and sal
soda, but carefully slide them in from a grocer's scoop held close to the side
of the pail and to the surface of the liquid. Perform the whole operation in a
well-ventilated place and avoid inhaling steam.</p>

<p>After the solution has become cold add water to make it to exactly 5
gallons,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> mix well, let settle, and draw
off into containers which can be tightly corked or otherwise closed. Jugs or
demijohns are best, but tin cans will serve if occasionally inspected for leaks
which may occur after a time through the action of the solution upon the solder
of the can.</p>

<p>Tar stock is prepared thus: In a large metal pail dissolve three-fourths of
a pound of caustic soda in 1 quart of water, add 1 gallon of pine tar, and stir
thoroughly with a wooden paddle until the mix<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>ture, which at first looks
streaked and muddy, brightens to a uniform, thick fluid somewhat resembling
molasses. Test it by letting about a teaspoonful drip from the paddle into a
glass of water (a glass fruit jar or a wide-mouth bottle will do) and stirring
thoroughly with a sliver of wood. It should mix perfectly with the water.
Globules of tar which can be seen by looking at the glass from underneath and
which can not be blended with the water by repeated stirring indicate that more
caustic-soda solution is needed. In that case make up more caustic-soda
solution of the same strength and add it, not more than a pint at a time, with
thorough stirring, until the desired effect is produced.</p>

<p>If an appropriate glass vessel for making the test is not at hand, take a
little of the mixture between the fingers, then dip the fingers under water and
try to rub off the tar. It should leave the fingers perfectly clean after a
little rubbing with water. If an oily coating remains, more caustic-soda
solution is needed. Such an extra addition of caustic soda will be required
only in case of a very low-grade chemical or a very highly acid tar. The tar
stock should be kept in closed containers, such as a pail with a friction
top.</p>

<p>The quantity of S-B arsenic stock or of tar stock made in one operation can
be varied as desired, provided the above-given proportions of the ingredients
are adhered to. But one should attempt to work the S-B formula on a larger
scale only after skill and experience have been acquired.</p>

<p><em>The boiled dip</em> is less convenient than the S-B dip, but the final
composition and effect of dipping baths prepared from the two are the same.</p>

<p>To make a 500-gallon bath provide:</p>

<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Sal-soda crystals</td>
      <td class="right">24 pounds.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">White arsenic</td>
      <td class="right">8 pounds.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Pine tar</td>
      <td class="right">1 gallon.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Put 25 gallons of water into a kettle or tank of from 40 to 50 gallons'
capacity, heat to boiling, and add the sal soda. When this has dissolved add
the white arsenic, then boil and stir for 15 minutes or longer, until the white
arsenic has entirely disappeared. If intended for immediate use cool to 140Â° F.
(by addition of cold water if desired), then pour in the pine tar in a thin
stream while constantly and vigorously stirring the solution. Immediately empty
the liquid into the dipping vat, which has already been three-fourths filled
with water, and stir thoroughly.</p>

<p>All the utensils must be free from greasy or oily matter which would coat
the arsenic and hinder its solution. The operation of boiling requires constant
attention to avoid loss by foaming. Hard water may be used, but in that case
considerable undissolved mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">
[Pg 491]</a></span>rial, which, however, does not contain any arsenic, may be
left after boiling.</p>

<p>For a stock solution to be kept on hand and used when needed add no tar, but
after the solution has become cold make it up to 25 gallons, stir well, let
settle, and draw off into containers which can be well closed. In this case the
tar stock previously described is also required.</p>

<p><em>Diluting the dip</em>.&mdash;First run water into the vat about three-fourths up
to the dipping line, at which its capacity must be known. If tar stock is to be
used the necessary amount will be one-third of a gallon for every 100 gallons
of vat capacity. Measure it out, mix it with 2 or 3 times its volume of water
and pour it along the surface of the water in the vat, stirring a little.</p>

<p>Every 100 gallons of standard-strength bath calls for 1-3/5 pounds white
arsenic, which quantity is contained in four-fifths of a gallon of S-B stock or
in 5 gallons of boiled stock. From these figures the quantity of arsenic or
stock needed to charge the vat may be calculated. Or one may base the
calculation on the following facts:</p>

<ul style="width: 50%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; list-style-type:none;">
  <li>One pound of white arsenic will make 62&frac12; gallons of bath.</li>
  <li>One gallon of S-B stock will make 125 gallons of bath.</li>
  <li>One gallon of boiled arsenic stock will make 20 gallons of bath.</li>
</ul>

<p>All solutions of arsenic are considerably heavier than water and if
carelessly put into the vat they may plunge to the bottom and be difficult to
mix. Therefore always pour the arsenic stock or a proprietary dip in a thin
stream evenly along the vat except at the shallow exit end. Another precaution
to be taken in handling proprietary dips is never to mix them first with small
quantities of water, which may "break" them. Pour them directly into the water
in the vat.</p>

<p>Finally, add water up to the dipping line and stir well. An excellent way to
stir is by a pail tied to a rope. Sink it at the entrance end of the vat and
haul it along the bottom to the exit. Then raise it, throw it back to the
entrance end, and haul through again, repeating as many times as necessary but
always hauling through in the same direction.</p>

<p>The standard-strength bath prepared as above contains practically 0.19 per
cent arsenious oxid when fresh. After use oxidation may set in and weaken it,
but it will not need to be strengthened so long as it tests not less than 0.175
per cent arsenious oxid.</p>

<p>To make up small quantities for spraying, to each 5 gallons of water
measured out add first 2 fluid ounces (4 tablespoonfuls) of tar stock, and then
5-1/8 fluid ounces of S-B stock or 2-1/8 pints of boiled arsenic stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
The standard strength of bath should be adhered to so far as possible
because its effectiveness against ticks will effect eradication in the least
time and with fewest dippings. But if time is not pressing it is sometimes best
to begin with a lower strength, say 0.14 or 0.15 per cent, and gradually work
up to full strength as the cattle become accustomed to the treatment. This is
certainly a wise method for the individual cattle owner who is outside the area
of cooperative work and who lacks aid and advice from experts. Weather
conditions also need to be considered. Hot or moist weather is more trying to
the cattle than cool or dry weather. The longer the time needed for the cattle
to dry off after dipping, which of course primarily depends on the proportion
of moisture in the air, the more liable they are to show blistering or other
injury through the continued absorption of arsenic by the skin. The combination
of heat and moisture is particularly bad, and under such conditions it may be
desirable, unless other conditions prohibit, to use the bath somewhat weaker
than standard strength. The following table shows the quantities of arsenic and
stock solutions contained in 100 gallons of bath of different strengths, so
that the quantities necessary to charge a vat of any size at any strength can
be found by simple multiplication.</p>

<p>As dipping goes on the bath naturally needs replenishing, and its strength
probably needs correction from time to time. Full directions on these points
may be found in Farmers' Bulletin 1057.</p>

<p><em>Prepared dips</em>.&mdash;Proprietary arsenical cattle dips appear now to have
passed the experimental stage and to have become established as reliable and
useful products. At any rate this can be said of the brands which have received
permission for use in official dipping in place of the homemade dip. The
formulas and standard samples of all such brands are in possession of the
Bureau of Animal Industry and the manufacturers are required to guarantee that
their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
products as placed on the market will be kept up to standard and that all
requirements of the bureau will be observed. Like the homemade dip they all
contain sodium arsenite as the active tick-killing agent. They do not all
contain pine tar, because that substance is difficult to blend into a highly
concentrated product, but they all contain some other substance or mixture of
substances of such character and in such quantity as field trials have proved
will produce the same effects.</p>

<p>They are not regarded as any more effective or any milder on the cattle
than properly prepared homemade dips. None the less they are undoubtedly
safer for general use because they offer decidedly fewer opportunities for
making mistakes in the quantities used or in the operations gone through and
also fewer chances for accidental poisoning or other injury from the handling
of powerful chemicals. Whether their higher cost is sufficiently outweighed
by these considerations is necessarily a matter for individual decision.</p>

<p><em>Precautions in the use of arsenic and arsenical dips</em>.&mdash;The fact that
arsenic is a violent poison is what renders it valuable, for the fever tick is
hard to kill. But, like a keen-edged tool, it may be decidedly dangerous if
ignorantly or carelessly handled. Three possibilities of danger must be kept
constantly in mind; danger to oneself, danger to other persons, danger to
animals.</p>

<p>The dry, powdered white arsenic should be kept in a tightly covered pail,
plainly labeled. Paper bags are unsafe because they easily burst, and arsenic
so scattered about looks harmless enough. In weighing or otherwise handling the
arsenic avoid raising dust or breathing it in, if raised, and keep it off the
skin and clothing. In mixing or boiling stock solutions work only in a
well-ventilated place, and on the windward side of the kettle so that steam
arising from it will not be inhaled.</p>

<p>The stock solutions are in some respects more dangerous than the original
substance because the arsenic in them is already in solution and can act very
quickly. If any gets on the skin or clothing it must be washed off without
delay. Cattle must be kept away from such solutions or from anything that has
been in contact with them, for cattle craving salt have been poisoned by
licking the outside of leaky barrels and by licking the earth around dipping
vats where a little concentrate had been carelessly spilled in charging the
vat. All such poisoned earth must be removed, buried, and replaced by fresh.</p>

<p>The diluted bath is naturally much less dangerous, but no chances can be
taken with it. No puddles from which animals may drink should be allowed to
accumulate. The persons who do the dipping should not allow the skin or
clothing to be wet by the dip any more or any longer than absolutely necessary.
When spraying, the opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">
[Pg 494]</a></span>tor should see to it that neither he nor the animals
inhale any of the spray.</p>

<p>When a vat is to be emptied the approved practice is to run the waste bath
into a pit properly guarded by a fence, where it will gradually seep away under
the surface and do no harm, provided only that seepage can not be carried to a
well, stream, or spring from which any person or domestic animal may drink.</p>

<p>The symptoms of arsenical poisoning are rather variable and also depend on
the size of the dose and the method of administration. If an animal sickens or
dies shortly after dipping it by no means follows that arsenical poisoning or
any other effect of the dipping is the cause. Very few cattle relative to the
total number dipped have suffered undoubted arsenical poisoning and in most of
the cases the cause could be traced to somebody's error or carelessness.</p>

<p>In regard to arsenical poisoning of human beings there is a standard
antidote, which may be obtained at any drug store with directions for use. It
should be kept on hand for emergencies. If the antidote is not at hand the
poison must be removed from the stomach by encouraging repeated vomiting, and
soothing drinks such as milk, white of eggs and water, or flour and water must
be freely given meanwhile. A suspected case of arsenical poisoning must have
the attention of a physician at the earliest possible moment, as sometimes the
poison works very quickly.</p>

<p><em>Crude petroleum</em>.&mdash;Various kinds of crude petroleum and emulsions of it
have been used with more or less success in destroying ticks, but on account of
the difficulty of obtaining suitable grades of oil and the liability of injury
to cattle, their use has been practically abandoned.</p>

<p><em>Method of dipping</em>.&mdash;The method usually adopted in dipping cattle is to
construct a narrow swimming tank with a chute at one end for the entrance of
the cattle, and a sloping exit at the other end when the cattle emerge after
passing through the vat. (See <a href="#PLATE_XLIX">Pl. XLIX</a>, fig. 2.) A
drip chute, or floor, is connected with the exit, where the excess of dip is
allowed to drip off the animals and to drain into the vat. Plans and
specifications for installing dipping plants may be obtained from the Bureau of
Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.</p>

<h5>TREATMENT.</h5>

<p>When Texas fever has broken out, all animals, the sick as well as the
healthy, should at once be removed to a noninfected pasture. While this may not
cut short the disease, it may save the lives of some by removing them from the
possibility of attack by more young ticks. Removal from infected pastures
likewise prevents a second <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">
[Pg 495]</a></span>attack, in October or early in November, which is
caused by another generation of ticks. Sick native cattle infect with a new
generation of ticks the pasture to which they are removed, but these usually
appear so late that they have but little opportunity to do any damage; hence,
sick natives do not, as a rule, cause visible disease in other natives.</p>

<p>It is of importance to remove all ticks, so far as this is possible, from
sick animals, since they abstract a considerable quantity of blood and thereby
retard the final recovery.</p>

<p>Medical treatment of the sick has generally been unsatisfactory, although in
chronic cases and those occurring late in the fall beneficial results have
followed. If the animal is constipated, a drench containing 1 pound of Epsom
salt dissolved in 1 quart of water should be administered, followed by sulphate
of quinin in doses of 30 to 90 grains, according to the size of the animal,
four times a day until the system is well saturated with it. Tincture of
digitalis one-half ounce and alcohol 2 ounces may be combined with the quinin,
according to indications of individual cases. An iron tonic containing reduced iron
2 ounces, powdered gentian 4 ounces, powdered nux vomica 2 ounces, powdered
rhubarb 2 ounces, and potassium nitrate 6 ounces will be found beneficial in
the convalescent stage when the fever has run its course. This tonic should be
given in heaping teaspoonful doses three times a day in the feed. Good nursing
is essential in treating these cases, and the animal should be given a
nutritious, laxative diet with plenty of clean and cool drinking water and
allowed to rest in a quiet place. If the stable or pasture is infested with
ticks, the animal should be placed in a tick-free inclosure to prevent
additional infestation with these parasites and the introduction of fresh
infection into the blood. Furthermore, all ticks that can be seen should be
removed from the sick cattle, as they keep weakening the animal by withdrawing
a considerable quantity of blood, and thereby retard recovery.</p>

<h5>QUARANTINE REGULATIONS.</h5>

<p>The sanitary regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture for the
control of cattle shipments from the infected districts have for their initial
purpose the prevention of the transportation of ticks from infected regions to
those that are not infected, either upon cattle or in stock cars or other
conveyer. They are based upon the fact that Texas fever is carried north only
by the cattle tick, and the exclusion of this parasite from the noninfected
territory has in every instance been found a certain method of excluding Texas
fever. The regulations governing the movement of cattle from below the quarantine
line are made yearly by the Secretary of Agriculture, and they define the boundary
of infected districts. The infected area as now determined is shown in maps
issued periodically.</p>

<p>In consequence of the enforcement of these quarantine regulations, Texas
fever has been practically prevented in the noninfected districts for several
years, and little or no hardship has been caused to stockmen handling cattle
from the infected areas. Prior to the adoption of these regulations the
tick-infested district was rapidly extending northward, but since the
quarantine line was established and rational regulations enforced it has
gradually been moved farther south. This problem of still further reducing the
infested area is of the greatest importance to the cattlemen of the
South&mdash;in fact, to those on both sides of the line&mdash;and one which is
receiving special consideration by this department as well as by many of the
interested States.</p>

<h5>TICK ERADICATION.</h5>

<p>Systematic cooperative work by the Federal Government and the affected
States for the eradication of the cattle ticks which transmit Texas fever was
begun in the summer of 1906 under authority given by Congress in the
appropriation act for the Department of Agriculture. The first Federal
appropriation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1907, was $82,500, and for the
fiscal year 1908 an appropriation of $150,000 was made, then for several years
$250,000, and this has been increased to $660,000 for 1922. Funds have also
been provided by States and counties.</p>

<p>The original infected area amounted to 728,543 square miles. Of this
territory there has been released from quarantine as a result of the work above
mentioned 523,837 square miles (up to July 1, 1922). In other words, 72 per
cent of the area has been freed from ticks in 16 years.</p>

<p>Great improvement has resulted from this work in the released territory.
More cattle are being raised, and a better grade of breeding stock is being
introduced; calves grow faster, and cattle put on flesh more rapidly during the
grazing season and go into the winter in better condition because of the
absence of the ticks; they can be marketed without quarantine restrictions, and
higher prices are being obtained; dairy cows give a larger yield of milk; and
values of farm lands are enhanced.</p>

<p>The difference between the prices realized for cattle from the tick-infested
region and the prices of cattle of similar grades from above the quarantine
line has ranged from $2.25 to $5 a head at the principal northern live-stock
markets, without taking into account the improvement in quality and weight of
cattle because of the eradication of the ticks. It can easily be seen that the
extermination of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">
[Pg 498]</a></span>ticks means a large total annual increase in the prices
obtained for southern cattle sold in northern markets. In addition to this, the
increase in prices of cattle sold locally in the South would represent a large
sum. This local increase has been found to amount to from $3 to $15 a head in
territory freed from ticks. An agricultural official of one of the Southern
States has reported that calves in the tick-free area bring double the prices
that can be obtained for similar calves in the tick-infested region.</p>

<p>Heretofore it has been impracticable to improve the quality of southern
cattle by introducing fine breeding animals from other sections, because such
animals were liable to contract Texas fever and die unless protected by
inoculation. Furthermore, it is impossible for animals to attain good growth
and to thrive when they are heavily infested with ticks. With the eradication
of the ticks, however, the southern farmers are enabled to introduce good
breeding animals and to improve the grade of their stock.</p>

<p>There is no longer any doubt that it is entirely practicable to exterminate
the ticks throughout the entire region, and the accomplishment of this result
will be of tremendous economic advantage not only to the South but to the whole
country. The rate of progress depends mainly on two factors&mdash; the amounts
appropriated by the Federal and State Governments, and the cooperation of the
people.</p>

<hr />

<h4>CHRONIC BACTERIAL DYSENTERY.</h4>

<p>Chronic bacterial dysentery is a chronic infectious disease of bovines
caused by an acid-fast bacillus simulating the tubercle bacillus and
characterized by marked diarrhea, anemia, and emaciation, terminating in
death.</p>

<p>This disease was observed in the United States for the first time by Pearson
in Pennsylvania cattle, and later by Mohler in Virginia cattle, and in an
imported heifer from the island of Jersey at the Athenia quarantine station of
the Bureau of Animal Industry.</p>

<p>Pearson proposed the name chronic bacterial dysentery for this affection,
and it has also been termed Johne's disease, chronic bacterial enteritis,
chronic hypertrophic enteritis, and chronic bovine pseudotuberculous enteritis
by various European investigators. The disease was first studied in 1895 by
Johne and Frothingham in Dresden, but they were inclined to attribute to the
avian tubercle bacillus the cause of the peculiar lesions of enteritis which
they observed. In 1904 Markus reported this disease in Holland, and
subsequently it was observed in Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Great
Britain.</p>

<p><em>Cause</em>.&mdash;The bacillus, which has been invariably demonstrated in the
intestinal lesions and mesenteric lymph glands in this disease, is a rod about
2 to 3 microns long and 0.5 micron wide. It stains more or less irregularly,
like the tubercle bacillus, and moreover the simi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499"
id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>larity goes further, in that the organism
is also strongly acid-fast, which facts led Johne and Frothingham to surmise
that the disease was caused by avian tubercle bacilli. However, it has now
been plainly demonstrated that the bacillus of chronic bacterial dysentery
is readily distinguished from the latter organisms, for while it resembles the
tubercle bacillus in form and staining qualities, no one has succeeded in
growing it in culture media or in reproducing the disease by injecting
experiment animals.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;Probably the first symptom noticed is that the animal is
losing condition despite the fact that its appetite is good and the food
nourishing. This is soon followed by a diarrhea which, while moderate at first,
soon becomes excessive and may be either irregular or persistent, the feces
being of the consistency of molasses and passed frequently. In the meantime the
hair becomes dry and harsh and the animal falls off considerably in weight. The
temperature, however, remains about normal. The appetite does not seem to be
greatly impaired until the last few weeks of life, but nevertheless emaciation
continues, the animal becomes more and more anemic, great muscular weakness and
exhaustion are manifested, and death follows, apparently as the result of the
persistent diarrhea and great emaciation. The disease may continue for four or
five weeks or may last for a year, or even longer, before death intervenes.</p>

<p><em>Lesions</em>.&mdash;The lesions observed on post-mortem are remarkably slight and
are out of all proportion to the severity of the symptoms manifested. The
disease appears to start in the small intestines, especially in the lower
portion, where the lesions are usually the most marked, but it also involves
the large intestines, including the rectum. The mucous membrane may alone be
affected, although usually in the long-standing cases the submucosa is also
invaded and the entire intestinal wall is then much thicker than normal and the
tissue infiltrated with an inflammatory exudate. The mucous membrane or inside
lining membrane is markedly wrinkled or corrugated, showing large, coarse folds
with more or less reddening or hemorrhagic patches or spots on the summits of
the ridges, especially noticeable in the large intestines. The mesenteric lymph
glands are usually somewhat enlarged and appear watery on section. The other
organs do not appear to be affected except from the anemia present in the later
stages of the disease.</p>

<p><em>Differential diagnosis</em>.&mdash;The principal disease with which bacterial
dysentery may be confused is tuberculosis, but the application of the
tuberculin test will readily diagnose the latter disease, while no reaction
will be noted in case the injected animal is suffering with the former
affection. The disease may also be mistaken for the parasitic affections
resulting from stomach worms (verminous gastritis) and intestinal parasites,
especially uncinariasis, but a microscopic exami<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500"
id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>nation of the feces is necessary in order to
establish definitely the diagnosis.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;As with all other forms of infectious disease, it is
advisable to separate immediately the diseased and suspected cattle from the healthy
animals. The feces passed by the former animals should be placed on cultivated
soil where healthy cattle will not be exposed to them, as the bacilli producing
the disease are readily found in such manure. The stalls, stables, and
barnyards should also be thoroughly disinfected, as has been described under
"Tuberculosis," in this chapter, special attention being given to those places
which have been soiled by feces. The administration of medicines has thus far
been quite unsatisfactory, although treatment should be directed toward
disinfecting the intestines with intestinal antiseptics, such as tannopin in 1
dram doses twice daily, and strengthening the animal by the use of stimulants
such as strychnin in half-grain doses given twice daily hypodermically. Salol,
turpentine, or subnitrate of bismuth in a starch or wheat-flour gruel may also
give temporary relief, but the diarrhea is likely to reappear and cause the
death of the animal. In all cases the feed must be carefully selected to assure
good quality, and should consist preferably of nutritious dry feed.</p>

<h4>NAGANA.</h4>

<p>Nagana, also called tsetse-fly disease, is an infectious fever occurring
chiefly in horses and cattle, characterized by alternating paroxysms and
intermissions and produced by a specific flagellate protozoan (<em>Trypanosoma
brucei</em>) in the blood. It is probably transmitted from animal to animal solely
by the bites of the tsetse fly. This insect is something like a large house
fly, and when it settles on a diseased animal, sucks the blood and infects its
proboscis, it is enabled on biting a second animal to infect the latter by
direct inoculation. This disease is found throughout a large portion of central
and southern Africa, along the low-lying and swampy valleys. It has never
occurred in the United States, nor is it known to be present in the
Philippines, but its relation to surra and the possibility of its appearance in
one of our island dependencies are the reasons for including a few remarks at
this time.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms</em>.&mdash;The chief symptoms in addition to the fever, which is
usually about 104Â° to 105Â° F., are the muscular wasting, progressive anemia,
and loss of power, together with the edema most marked about the head, legs,
abdomen, and genital organs. The urine is yellow and turbid, and occasionally
contains albumin and blood. There is paralysis of one or both of the hind legs,
difficult urination and defecation, labored breathing, discharge from the eyes
and nose, extreme thirst, and gradual extension of paralysis to other parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
the body. The disease runs a chronic course, lasting from three to six weeks in
horses, and from one to six months in cattle. Besides these animals, the mule,
ass, buffalo, antelope, hyena, camel, and dog contract the disease naturally,
and sheep, goats, cats, and small laboratory animals succumb to artificial
inoculation.</p>

<p><em>Lesions</em>.&mdash;The spleen and lymphatic glands are enlarged. There are
sero-fibrinous exudates in the body cavities, the liver is enlarged and
engorged, heart flabby, and a catarrhal condition is present in the respiratory
passages. Pathological changes occur in the spinal cord. The finding of the
trypanosoma by microscopic examination of the blood will be conclusive evidence
for diagnosis.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment has not proved satisfactory. Quinin, arsenic,
methylene blue, and other drugs have been used, but without success. Endeavors
thus far made to produce immunity from this disease have likewise been
unavailing.</p>

<h4>CATTLE FARCY.</h4>

<p>This is a chronic disease of cattle occurring in France and the island of
Guadeloupe, West Indies. It is characterized by caseating nodular swellings,
first of the skin and afterwards of the superficial lymphatic vessels and
glands, finally proving fatal within a year by extension to the viscera. The
swellings rupture and discharge a purulent yellowish fluid, which contains the
causative organism. This affection, called farcin du b&oelig;uf by the French,
resembles cutaneous glanders or farcy of horses, but is caused by an entirely
different organism, the streptothrix of Nocard. Moreover, cattle are immune
from glanders, and for this reason the name, unfortunately applied to this
disease, should not lead to any confusion with the cutaneous glanders or farcy
of horses. Although the disease has been described as occurring only in
Guadeloupe and France, the possibility of its occurrence in American
possessions warrants its mention in this chapter.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Treatment consists in making incisions into the swellings
and syringing them out with 2 per cent compound cresol solution. The cavities
may then be packed with cotton, soaked in 5 per cent zinc-chlorid solution. The
swollen lymphatics may also be bathed or covered with cloths wrung out in this
solution.</p>

<h2><a name="ANIMAL_PARASITES_OF_CATTLE"
id="ANIMAL_PARASITES_OF_CATTLE"></a>ANIMAL PARASITES OF CATTLE.</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">B. H. Ransom, Ph. D.</span>,</h3>

<h5><em>Chief of Zoological Division, Bureau of Animal Industry</em>.</h5>

<p>The animal parasites of cattle comprise more than a hundred different
species, belonging to various groups of the animal kingdom. Fortunately not all
these parasites occur in this country&mdash;many are uncommon, and many are
comparatively harmless. Some forms, however, occur frequently, and some are of
distinct importance to the American stockman on account of the damage for which
they are responsible. It is these parasites particularly which will be referred
to in the present article, and although some forms are discussed which are rare
or apparently of little economic importance, most of the minor and unusual parasites
and species not found in this country have been omitted from consideration.</p>

<h4>FLIES.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h4>

<p>Of the various species of flies which infest cattle some are injurious on
account of the annoyance, pain, and loss of blood due to their bites, and
sometimes also on account of diseases or parasites which are thus transmitted
from the blood of diseased animals to that of healthy cattle, while others,
which in the winged adult state do not bite, are injurious because they live
parasitic on cattle during their larval stages.</p>

<p><em>Remedies for flies</em>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;Most remedies used for
protecting cattle from the attacks of flies have to be applied frequently, and
few, if any, will keep flies away for more than a day or two following their
application. The numerous proprietary fly repellents to be found on the market
are usually more expensive, and often less efficacious than homemade
mixtures.</p>

<p>At the Minnesota experiment station rancid lard 1 pound and kerosene
one-half pint, mixed thoroughly until a creamy mass forms, was found to give
excellent results as a fly repellent, lasting for two or three days, when
rubbed not too thickly with a cloth or with the bare hand over the backs of
cows. Mixtures of cottonseed oil and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503"
id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>pine tar containing from 10 to 50 per cent
of the latter substance were found by investigations in the Bureau of Animal
Industry to have a marked repellent action against flies when applied lightly
every day. A too free application of tar mixtures and other preparations
containing phenols is liable to cause poisoning; hence care should be observed
in this regard.</p>

<p>Jensen (1909) recommends the following formula, which is said to protect
cows for a week:</p>

<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
    <tr>

      <td class="right">ounces.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Cut the soap into thin shavings and dissolve in water by the aid of heat;
dissolve the naphthalin in the crude oil, mix the two solutions, put them into
an old dasher churn, and mix thoroughly for 15 minutes. The mixture should be
applied once or twice a week with a brush. It must be stirred well before being
used.</p>

<h5>THE STABLE FLY (STOMOXYS CALCITRANS).<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h5>

<p>This fly very closely resembles the house fly, but, unlike the latter, it is
a biting fly. It is common about stables and often enters dwellings, especially
in cloudy weather. According to NoÃ©, it is the agent of transmission of a
parasitic roundworm of cattle (<em>Setaria labiato-papillosa</em>, see <a href="#Page_529">p. 529</a>).
This fly has been shown capable of transmitting anthrax from diseased to healthy animals,
and under some conditions it may transmit surra, a disease caused by a blood
parasite which affects horses, cattle, and other livestock.</p>

<p>The annoyance suffered by cattle and horses from stable flies is much
lessened if the stables are darkened.</p>

<p>The screening of doors and windows, however, is preferable, as ventilation
is not interfered with as it is in darkening stables. For milk cows coverings
made from burlap (double thickness), including trouserlike coverings for the
legs, may be used when the flies are very numerous and troublesome. One of the
fly repellents mentioned above may be applied to cattle to protect them from
stable flies. The Hodge flytrap fitted to the windows of dairy barns is a
useful means of destroying stable flies. The United States Bureau of Entomology
has found that a mixture of fish oil (1 gallon), oil of pine tar (2 ounces),
oil of pennyroyal (2 ounces), and kerosene (&frac12; pint) is fairly effective for a
short time when applied lightly, but thoroughly, to the portions of animals not
covered with blankets. The risk of poisoning with tar mixtures as already
mentioned should be borne in mind in using this remedy. Care should be taken to
apply it lightly.</p>

<p>The stable fly breeds in moist accumulations of straw, chaff, cow or horse
manure, and various fermenting vegetable substances. The <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>dÃ©bris collecting in
and under outdoor feed troughs, and the remains of straw stacks are favorable
breeding places for the stable fly. Under the most favorable conditions about
three weeks are required for development from the egg to the adult stage.</p>

<p>The proper care of straw and the proper disposal of stable manure are very
necessary in the control of stable flies. Straw stacks should be carefully
built so as to shed rain, and loose straw or chaff should be scattered or
burned. Straw not required for winter feed should be promptly disposed of by
burning or scattering and plowing it under. Stable manure should be hauled out
and scattered at regular intervals, preferably every three days, and the
vicinity of stables should be kept free from accumulations of straw and hay
that may become wet and serve as breeding places for the stable fly.</p>

</div>

<p style="width: 65%; float: right;">This
fly, now found nearly everywhere in the United States, was introduced
into this country from Europe about the year 1885. Hornflies have the habit of
clustering about the base of the horn (fig. 2), whence the name by which they
are popularly known. They do not damage the horn, and congregate there only to
rest.</p>

<p style="width: 65%; float: right;">In
view of the general practice of dehorning cattle, the name hornfly is
less distinctive than it once was. Moreover, hornflies rest on other parts of the
body as well as the horns.</p>

<p style="width: 65%; float: right;">When
resting, their wings are held down close to the body (fig. 1); when
feeding, their wings are held out nearly at right angles, ready for flight.
They puncture the skin and suck blood, usually attacking the upper parts of the
body, particularly those which are out of reach of the animal's head or tail.
Unlike most flies, they remain on the animal more or less constantly, day and
night. Owing probably to the irritation and annoyance caused by these flies,
cattle often do not thrive as they should during seasons when the flies are
numerous. The hornfly has also been charged with transmitting diseases, such as
anthrax.</p>

The fly lays its eggs in freshly dropped cow manure. They hatch in about 24
hours, and the larvÃ¦ or maggots in four or five days develop to the pupal
stage, which lasts a week or 10 days. From the pupal stage the mature fly
emerges. The entire process of development from the deposition of the egg to
the appearance of the mature fly therefore may be completed in two weeks, or
even in a shorter time. To protect cattle from attacks of the hornfly they may
be treated with one of the remedies mentioned above (<a href="#Page_502">p. 502</a>).
Dipping cattle in a vat provided with splashboards set at the proper angle destroys
most of the hornflies present on the animals. Unless the splashboards are used all but a
few of the flies succeed in escaping as the cattle plunge into the bath and
later return to them. Scattering the droppings of cattle with a shovel, or with
brush dragged over pastures, in order to insure the rapid drying of the manure
and consequent destruction of the larvÃ¦, is, when practicable, an efficient
means of reducing the number of these flies.</p>

</div>

<p style="margin-left: 340px;">These small flies, also known as black flies, are about one-eighth of an
inch long and have a characteristic "humped" back (fig. 3). They breed in
running water and appear in swarms during spring and summer, often in enormous
numbers, causing great annoyance to stock and human beings, on account of their
bites and their entrance into the eyes, nose, mouth, and other openings of the
body. Their bites appear to be poisonous, and in seasons especially favorable
to the gnats heavy losses of horses and cattle often occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 340px;">Buffalo gnats are more troublesome in bright, sunny weather than when it is
cloudy, and animals which have not shed their winter coats suffer more from
their attacks than those with smooth coats. Cattle kept in darkened stables are
not molested. The application of one of the fly repellents already mentioned
(<a href="#Page_502">p. 502</a>) may help to protect <span class="pagenum"><a

</p>

<p>Screw worms (fig. 4) are the maggots of a fly (<em>Chrysomyia macellaria</em>),
so called from their fancied resemblance to a screw. The adult fly (fig. 5) is
about one-third of an inch long, with a bluish-green body, red eyes, and with
three dark longitudinal stripes on the back (thorax). Attracted by odors of 3.
decay, it deposits its eggs, 300 to 400 at a time, in cuts, sores, castration
wounds, etc. The crushing of a tick on the skin commonly results in screw-worm
infection at that point. The eggs hatch in a few hours and the larvÃ¦ or maggots,
or so-called screw worms, begin to burrow into the flesh and continue burrowing
and feeding from three to six days, after which they leave the wound and crawl
into the earth, there transforming into the quiescent pupal stage. This stage
is completed in three to fourteen days. The mature flies then emerge from the
pupal envelope and are soon ready for egg laying. From two to three weeks are
therefore required for the entire life cycle, although under certain conditions
it is possible for the fly to undergo its full development in as short a time
as seven days, and on the other hand as long as a month is often required.
<br />
Besides cattle, the screw-worm fly attacks sheep, horses, dogs, and man. In
the case of hogs it is generally the ears which are affected. The fly also
breeds in dead animals, and all carcasses should therefore be buried deeply or
burned. The complete destruction of all dead animals by burning has been found
by the Bureau of Entomology to be by far the best method of controlling screw
worms.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for screw worms</em>.&mdash;For proper treatment an animal suffering
from screw worms should be caught and thrown. Chloroform is then poured into
the wound, taking care that it penetrates thoroughly into all the burrows of
the screw worm, if necessary using a slender stick or a small bunch of twisted
hay as a probe. The animal should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507"
id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>be held for several minutes in order to
insure the continued action of chloroform. Instead of chloroform, gasoline may
be used, and carbon tetrachlorid is said by some authorities to give good
results. Finally, the dead or dying maggots may be removed with forceps, the
wound washed with a weak carbolic or cresylic acid solution, and painted with
pine tar to reduce the chances of further attack by flies. Finally the wound
should be dressed with a carbolic or cresylic ointment to promote healing and
thus prevent further infection, or the wound may be painted with pine tar.
Dipping in the arsenical dips used for destroying cattle ticks is a convenient
method of treatment if many animals are involved.</p>

</div>

<p style="width: 65%; float: left;">Ox warbles are whitish or, when full grown, dark-colored grubs or maggots
that develop from the eggs deposited on the hairs of cattle by certain flies
known as warble flies. In the United States there are two species of ox-warble
flies, technically known as <em>Hypoderma lineatum</em> and <em>Hypoderma bovis</em>. These flies
somewhat resemble bees in their general appearance, but like all flies have
only two wings.</p>

<p style="width: 65%; float: left;">The first named, <em>H. lineatum</em>, is commonly called the heel fly and is more
generally distributed over the United States than the other species. The tail
has a distinctive reddish-orange color and the legs are rough and hairy. This
fly commonly deposits its eggs about the coronet, whence the name of heel fly,
and on the fetlocks, knees, and hocks. When cattle are resting, eggs are
deposited along the line of contact of the body with the soil. Cattle are
frequently indifferent to the activity of this fly in depositing its eggs.
Commonly 8 to 10 eggs, sometimes as many as 14, are attached to a single
hair.</p>

<p style="width: 65%; float: left;">In the United States the other warble fly, <em>H. bovis</em>, has been found only in
the North (New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, Iowa,
Missouri, and Washington) and has not yet been found in the Southern States.
The tail is orange-yellow, lighter in color than that of the other species, and
the legs have but few hairs. This fly commonly deposits its eggs on the outside
of the hind quarters and above the fetlocks when the animals are moving, or
lower down if they are quiet. Cattle are usually much disturbed by the activity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
of this fly and not infrequently appear terror stricken. The eggs are attached
singly, one egg to a hair near its base.</p>

<p style="float: left;">The eggs of the warble flies hatch as a rule in about a week, the time
varying with local conditions. The young warble is about 1 mm. (1/25 inch)
long. It crawls to the base of the hair and burrows into the hair follicle. The
entrance of the larvÃ¦ frequently causes sudden appearance of swellings. The
larvÃ¦ of <em>H. bovis</em> in entering the skin rarely cause a flow of serum</p>

<div class="figcentern" style="width: 640px;">

</div>

<p>or pus formation, but those of <em>H. lineatum</em> commonly cause a considerable
flow of serum with pus formation resulting in a matting of the hair on affected
areas of the skin. The warbles after penetrating the skin migrate through the body
and ultimately reach the backs of the cattle, <em>H. lineatum</em> usually appearing
there in northern latitudes about the middle of December and <em>H. bovis</em>
about a month later. During their migrations, before they reach the back, the
young warbles spend a considerable period <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509"
id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>in the walls of the esophagus, or gullet, and may
be found in this location as early as August 15. During the fall and winter a large
proportion of the gullets of cattle that are slaughtered are found to be infested
with warbles, and are known as grubby gullets or weasands in the packing houses.</p>

<p>When the warbles first appear in the back they are about 3/5 inch long. They
cause swellings about the size of pigeons' eggs, each swelling having a small
hole in the center, which has been punctured in the skin by the warble to
enable it to breathe. Through this hole the warble leaves the back of the cow
when it has completed its parasitic stage of development, at which time it
measures nearly an inch in length.</p>

<p>The full-grown larvÃ¦ begin to leave the backs of the cattle early in the
year, and in northern latitudes the last leave before the middle of July. After
leaving the backs of the cattle they burrow into the ground, lie quiescent for
about a month, and become transformed into mature flies. In northern latitudes
the mature flies of the species <em>H. lineatum</em> may be observed during April and
May, and those of the other species during June and July.</p>

<p>The damage caused by warbles includes injury to stampeding cattle frightened
by the fly, decreased milk flow and diminished growth in infested animals, and
injury to hides, the last item being especially serious.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The best method of control known at present is to extract
the warbles from the backs of cattle and kill them. If they are almost ready to
leave the cattle, they may be squeezed from the backs with the fingers. Forceps
are useful in removing the warbles, but it is important to be careful in
extracting warbles not to crush them, as the body juices of these parasites are
sometimes poisonous to cattle if absorbed into their circulation. In the South
herds may be examined in November or early in December and once a month during
the next two or three months. In the North the first examination may be made
six weeks to two months later, with two or, better, three following
examinations at intervals of a month. If this procedure is carefully carried
out there will be a noticeable diminution of warbles the following year, and if
persisted in the warble can be almost if not completely eradicated. Where an
entire community follows up the practice of removing and destroying warbles,
the results are highly beneficial.</p>

<p>As a result of recent studies by various investigators it appears that the
tiny grubs, newly hatched from the eggs, may gain entrance to the body by
penetrating directly through the skin. Many observers, however, have held that
the eggs or newly hatched larvÃ¦ are taken into the mouth by the cattle licking
themselves. It is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]
</a></span>possible, as in the case of several other parasites, that
both modes of infection may occur and that the larvÃ¦ may gain entrance to the
body either by penetrating the skin or by being swallowed. From the evidence at
present available it seems likely that the usual mode of entrance is through
the skin. Irrespective of the mode of infection, the larvÃ¦ evidently wander
extensively through the tissues of the body, developmental stages being found
in considerable numbers in the wall of the esophagus during the fall of the
year. They have also been found in the spinal canal and in various other
locations. Finally, about January they appear beneath the skin of the back,
forming the well-known swellings. The posterior end of the grub is near the
small opening in the hide, through which the grub breathes and discharges its
excrement, and through which, when its development is complete, it finally
escapes. The anterior end of the grub is at the bottom of the tumor, where the
mucus collects upon which it feeds. By spring or early summer the grub is full
grown and forces its way out of the skin, falling to the ground, into which it
burrows for a short distance and transforms into the pupal stage. In about a
month the mature fly emerges.</p>

<p>It has lately been discovered that a second species of warble fly (<em>Hypoderma
bovis</em>) common in Europe is of not uncommon occurrence in Canada and the
northern part of the United States, whereas it was formerly supposed that the
ox warbles of this country were all of the one kind. The general appearance,
life history, and effects of the European species are much the same as those of
the American form.</p>

<p>Grubs weaken cattle, cause them to fall off in flesh and milk, and decrease
the value of the hide. The beef in the immediate vicinity of a grub becomes
slimy and of a greenish color, and is known to the butchers as "licked
beef."</p>

<p>The total loss to this country on account of the warble fly is estimated at
$35,000,000 to $50,000,000 a year, at the least, and may amount to considerably
more.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for warbles</em>.&mdash;During the winter and spring examine the cattle
for the presence of warbles. By passing the hand over the backs of the animals
the swellings marking the location of the grubs may be readily found. Pressure
properly applied to the swellings will cause the grubs to "pop out" if they
have reached a late stage of development. They may be more easily removed by
means of slender forceps inserted into the opening of the warbles, and a still
more certain method of removing them, particularly if the lumps are still very
small, is to cut into the swellings with a sharp knife or bistoury, after which
they may be pressed out. Care should be taken <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511"
id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>to crush all grubs removed, so as to prevent the
possibility of their further development and transformation into flies. In order
that none may escape it is advisable to examine the cattle every two weeks
during the late winter and spring, at each examination removing the grubs which
have developed sufficiently to cause perceptible swellings.</p>

<p>Another method of treatment is to force grease or oil into the openings of
the warbles, which kills the grubs. This method is less certain than that of
removing the grubs, and has the further objection that the dead grubs remain
beneath the skin.</p>

<p>Cattle may be treated during the summer with fly repellents (<a href="#Page_502">p. 502</a>)
to keep off the warble flies. The efficacy of repellents against these flies is
probably, however, not very great.</p>

<p>In localities where the character of the cattle industry is such as to
render practicable the systematic examination of cattle and the removal of the
grubs&mdash;that is, where the herds are comparatively small and subject to the
close supervision of the owners&mdash;it is possible, by the exercise of a
little care and with very little effort on the part of the cattle owners,
provided they work together, each doing his share by seeing to the removal of
grubs from his own cattle, so that as few as possible survive to transform into
flies, to reduce the number of grubs within one or two seasons almost, if not
entirely, to the point of extinction.</p>

<p>Investigations not yet completed indicate that grub eradication may
sometimes be accomplished by the use of arsenical dips, which are extensively
used at the present time for destroying cattle ticks. (See <a href="#Page_497">p. 497</a>.)
It is possible that the destructive action of arsenical dips upon warbles is more or
less dependent upon the fact that arsenic is stored up in small quantities in
and upon the skin of cattle that are repeatedly dipped in arsenical dips. The
arsenical dip appears to act, not upon the well-developed grub beneath the
skin, but upon the eggs or the newly hatched larvÃ¦, probably the latter.
Accordingly the dipping of cattle to destroy grubs should be carried out during
the fly season and repeated treatments should be given every two or three
weeks, as in dipping cattle to eradicate ticks.</p>

<h5>LICE.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h5>

<p>Cattle in the United States are commonly infested with three species of
lice, two of them sucking lice (<em>H&aelig;matopinus eurysternus</em>, the short-nosed cattle
louse, and <em>Linognathus vituli</em>, the long-nosed cattle louse), commonly known as
blue lice, and one biting louse (<em>Trichodectes scalaris</em>), commonly known as the
red louse.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
The blue lice (figs. 7 and 8) suck the blood of cattle and are more
injurious than the red lice (fig. 9). Unless very abundant the latter cause
little injury. If numerous they irritate and worry their host probably more by
their sharp claws than by their bites, as their food seems to consist entirely
of particles of hair and dead skin.</p>

(<em>Linognathus vituli</em>) of cattle. Enlarged. (From Bureau of Entomology.)</span>
</div>

<p>Cattle lice reproduce by means of eggs or nits (fig. 10) which they fasten
to the hair. The blue lice infest chiefly the neck and shoulders; red lice,
when present, may be found almost anywhere on the body, but are usually most
numerous on neck, shoulders, and at the root of the tail.</p>

<p>On account of the itching caused by the lice, infested cattle rub against
posts, trees, etc., and lick themselves, the hair sometimes coming out and the
skin becoming thickened so that mange may be suspected.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for lice</em>.&mdash;Cattle may be treated for lice by means of hand
applications, spraying, or dipping. Dusting powders sold under various trade
names are of value in helping to hold lice in check when the weather is too
cold for dipping or spraying. The application of greases and insecticidal
liquids by hand is fairly effective and practicable in cases in which there are
only a few animals to be treated. The following remedies have proved effective
when applied by hand, the treatment being repeated if necessary in about 16
days: (1) Cottonseed oil and kerosene, equal parts; (2) kerosene, &frac12; pint,
mixed with lard, 1 pound; (3) crude petroleum; (4) any of the dips recommended
for use in dipping, and diluted in the same proportions as for dipping. Oils or
greases should not be used in very warm or very cold weather. The remedies
mentioned may be applied with a brush or a cloth. They should be distributed in
a thin, even coating over the surface of the body, taking care that there is no
excess quantity at any point.</p>

<p>In spraying, any of the dips recommended for lice, properly diluted, are
applied by means of a spray pump over the entire body. Thorough wetting of the
skin and hair is important, and a second treatment should be given 15 or 16
days later.</p>

Two dippings should be given 15 or 16 days apart. Dipping in the fall is good
insurance against risk of loss from lice during the winter. All animals in the
herd should be treated regardless of the number showing infestation. Either
coal-tar-creosote or nicotin dips may be used. These are sold under various
trade names. The directions for dilution given by the manufacturer should be
carefully followed. As coal-tar-creosote dips do not mix well with all kinds of
water, they should be tested with the water to be used for making the solution
by mixing some of the dip in the proper proportions with the water in a clean
and clear-glass bottle or jar. If an oily layer or mass of globules collects
either at the top or the bottom of the mixture after standing an hour, the dip
is not suitable for use with that kind of water. Imperfectly mixed
coal-tar-creosote dips are liable to poison animals even when not used in
stronger solutions than that recommended by the manufacturers, and are also
likely to be inefficacious.</p>

class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h4>

<p>Cattle are subject to four kinds of mange, of which common mange or psoroptic
mange is the most important.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 376px;">

</div>

<div style="width: 60%; float: right;">
<h5>PSOROPTIC MANGE.</h5>

<p>Psoroptic mange of cattle is caused by small
mites (fig. 11) which multiply rapidly and are spread from diseased to healthy cattle
by bodily contact, or by pens, stables, railroad cars, etc., recently occupied by
mangy cattle. The mites attack the skin and cause it to become thickened and covered
with crusts and scabs, with a consequent loss of hair. Intense itching accompanies the
disease, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a>
</span>and affected cattle are more or less constantly rubbing and licking
themselves. Psoroptic mange commences at the root of the tail, or on the neck,
or withers, and gradually extends over the back up to the head, over the sides,
and may finally affect nearly the entire body except the legs. In serious cases
the skin may become ulcerated; the animals are greatly weakened and emaciated,
and finally die. By taking scrapings from the edges of scabby patches and
placing them on a piece of black paper in a warm place the mites may be seen as
tiny white objects crawling over the paper, more distinctly if a magnifying
glass is used. Mange may be confused with lousiness, ringworm, or with any
condition in which there is itching or loss of hair, but if mites are found
there is no question of the diagnosis. The disease is worse during cold, wet
weather. Mangy cattle when on good pasture during the summer often seem to
recover, but in the fall the disease again appears in a severe form.</p>


<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;The most generally used and most satisfactory method of
treating cattle mange consists in dipping the animals in a vat filled with a
liquid of such nature that it will kill the parasites without injuring the
cattle. Vats for dipping cattle are built of wood, stone, or concrete, and vary
in length from 30 to 100 feet or more. They vary in width from 3 to 7 feet at
the top and 1&frac12; to 3 feet at the bottom, and the depth may be from 7 to 10
feet. A narrow chute through which the cattle are driven leads to one end of
the vat, where a steep slide pitches the cattle into the dipping fluid, through
which they swim, and climb out of the vat at the other end, which is built
sloping and provided with cross cleats to <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>give the animals a foothold. A
draining pen with floor sloping back toward the vat is generally provided. The
dip should be used warm, 100Â° to 105Â° F., and the cattle should be held in the
vat for two minutes to insure thorough action of the dip. The head of each
animal should be ducked at least once. Care should be taken that the vat
contains a sufficient depth of fluid to swim the animals to be dipped. The
dipping fluid may be heated from a steam boiler by pipes or hose, or water
heated in large iron cauldrons or tanks may be used for charging the vat, and
hot water with a proper quantity of dip added from time to time as the dipping
fluid becomes cool.</p>

<p>If crude-petroleum dips are used, one dipping is usually sufficient, and the
dip is used cold. Crude-petroleum dips are rarely used for common mange, but
are of special value for sarcoptic mange, which is cured with difficulty by the
ordinary dips. In the treatment of ordinary mange with lime-sulphur or nicotin
dips two dippings are necessary, the second dipping being given 10 to 14 days
after the first. The second treatment is necessary to kill the few parasites
which sometimes escape at the first treatment, either in the egg stage or as
fecundated females.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h5>LIME-SULPHUR DIP.</h5>

<p>The lime-sulphur dip is made in the proportion of 12 pounds of unslaked lime
(or 16 pounds of commercial hydrated lime&mdash;not air-slaked lime), 24 pounds
of flowers of sulphur, and 100 gallons of water.</p>

<p><em>Directions for preparing 100 gallons of dip</em>.&mdash;Weigh out the lime, 12
pounds (or hydrated lime, 16 pounds), and sulphur, 24 pounds. Place the
unslaked lime in a shallow, water-tight box similar to a mortar box, or some
other suitable vessel, and add water enough to slake the lime and form a lime
paste or lime putty. Sift into this paste the flowers of sulphur and stir well;
then place the lime-sulphur paste in a kettle, boiler, or tank containing 30
gallons of water, the water being first heated nearly to the boiling point.
Boil the mixture for two hours at least, stirring frequently; add water
occasionally to maintain the original quantity. Allow the mixture to settle in
the tank or draw the entire contents of the kettle or boiling tank into a large
tub or barrel placed near the dipping vat and provided with a bunghole about 4
inches from the bottom, and then allow ample time to settle&mdash;from two to
three hours or more if necessary. When fully settled, draw off the clear liquid
into the dipping vat, taking care not to allow any of the sediment to accompany
it, as the sediment is liable to render the dip unnecessarily caustic. The
clear liquid thus obtained requires only the addition of sufficient clear warm
water to bring the total up to 100 gallons. Flowers of sulphur must be used and
the lime must be of good quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
The dipping bath should be used at a temperature of 100Â° to 105Â° F., and for
official dippings must be maintained at all times at a strength of not less
than 2 per cent of "sulphid sulphur" as indicated by the Bureau of Animal
Industry field test for lime-sulphur baths.</p>

<h5>NICOTIN DIP.</h5>

<p>The nicotin dip is made with sufficient extract of tobacco, or nicotin
solution, to give a mixture containing not less than five one-hundredths of 1
per cent nicotin and 2 per cent flowers of sulphur. Sufficient nicotin would
therefore be furnished for 96 gallons (about 800 pounds) of dip by 1 pound of a
40 per cent solution of nicotin. The formula for this dip would be: Nicotin,
four-tenths of a pound; flowers of sulphur, 16 pounds; water, 96 gallons.</p>

<p>To calculate how much nicotin solution or extract of tobacco should be used
for 96 gallons of water, divide the quantity of nicotin required in the dip by
the proportion of nicotin in the extract. For example, suppose the nicotin
solution contains 25 per cent nicotin, we have 0.40 Ã· 0.25 = 1.6. Therefore in
this case it would require 1.6 pounds of nicotin solution for the 96 gallons of
dip. Or, if a tobacco extract is used, having, for example, 2.4 per cent of
nicotin, the formula would be as follows: 0.40 Ã· 0.024 = 16.66, and therefore
16.66 pounds would be required for 96 gallons of dip. Do not use any
preparation the strength of which is not given on the outside of the
package.</p>

<p>In preparing these dips the nicotin solution and sulphur should be mixed
together with water before adding them to the water in the dipping vat. On no
account should the dip be heated above 110Â° F. after the nicotin solution is
added, as heat is liable to evaporate the nicotin and weaken the dip.</p>

<p>For official dippings the dipping bath should be used at a temperature of
100Â° to 105Â° F. and at all times must be maintained at a strength of not less
than five one-hundredths of 1 per cent nicotin as indicated by a field test
approved by the Bureau of Animal Industry.</p>

<p>A homemade nicotin dip may be prepared as follows:</p>

<p>For each 100 gallons of dip desired, take 21 pounds of good, prepared
tobacco leaves; soak the leaves in cold or lukewarm water for 24 hours in a
covered pot or kettle; then bring the water to near the boiling point for a
moment, and, if in the morning, allow the infusion to draw for an hour; if in
the evening, allow it to draw overnight; the liquid is next strained (pressure
being used to extract as much nicotin as possible from the wet leaves) and
diluted to 100 gallons per 21 pounds of tobacco. This dip should be used as
fresh as possible, as it contains a large amount of organic material which will
soon decompose.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
</p>

<h5>CRUDE-PETROLEUM DIPS.</h5>

<p>Crude-petroleum dips, which are valuable for the treatment of sarcoptic
mange, are not often used for the treatment of psoroptic mange or of chorioptic
mange, oily dips being liable to injure animals, especially if they are moved
rapidly soon after treatment, if they are exposed to bright sunshine, or if
they become chilled. Besides unprocessed crude petroleum, processed petroleum
from which the gasoline and other light hydrocarbons have been removed may be
utilized in the treatment of cattle for mange, particularly sarcoptic mange.
There are a number of proprietary brands of crude-petroleum dips on the market,
consisting of processed crude petroleum with other substances added, mainly
lighter oils to give the dip a suitable consistency. In dipping cattle in
crude-petroleum dips fill the vat with water to within 1 foot or 18 inches of
the dip line and then add the oil until the surface is flush with the dip line.
The oil floats on the water, and as the animals pass through the vat their
bodies become coated with oil.</p>
</div>

<h5>CHORIOPTIC MANGE.</h5>

<p>Chorioptic mange, due to a species of mite different from that causing
common cattle mange, is confined almost entirely to the region at the root of
the tail and if not treated may persist for years. The treatment is the same as
for psoroptic mange.</p>

<h5>SARCOPTIC MANGE.</h5>

<p>Sarcoptic mange, frequently called "barn itch," is caused by a mite very
similar to that which causes itch in human beings. It commonly affects the head
and neck, but may also occur on various other parts of the body. Bulls are
particularly liable to be affected with this form of mange. Cattle may become
infected not only from other cattle, but also from horses, goats, dogs, sheep,
and hogs. As a rule sarcoptic mange in any species of animal, if acquired from
an animal of another species, is likely to run a short course and tend toward a
spontaneous recovery.</p>

<p>The treatment likely to be most efficacious is that of dipping in a
crude-petroleum dip, one treatment as a rule being sufficient. If lime-sulphur
dip is used, four or five successive treatments, or even more, at weekly
intervals, may be necessary before a cure is effected.</p>

<h5>DEMODECTIC MANGE.</h5>

<p>Demodectic mange, which is caused by a small parasite that lives in the hair
follicles, causing pustules, especially on the neck and shoulders, occurs
occasionally among cattle in this country and is of importance on account of
the injury to the hide. When tanned, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518"
id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>hides infested by this parasite are
pitted, the pits, in some cases, being so deep that they form holes. No
practicable treatment is known for this disease.</p>

<h4>TICKS.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h4>

<p>About 10 species of ticks have been reported as parasites of cattle in the
United States. The most common and most important is the species known as
<em>Margaropus annulatus</em>, which transmits Texas fever. Information concerning this
tick and Texas fever has been given elsewhere in this volume (<a href="#Page_475">p. 475</a>).</p>

<p>The spinose ear tick (<em>Ornithodoros megnini</em>) is frequently found in the ears
of cattle in the western part of the United States, and is of common occurrence
also in the ears of horses, dogs, cats, etc.</p>

<p>When its parasitic stage of development is completed the ear tick leaves its
host. Mating between the sexes occurs after the ticks have cast their skins
following the abandonment of their host. They usually crawl up some distance
from the ground and secrete themselves in cracks and crevices in trees, walls
of buildings, etc., where the females deposit their eggs.</p>

<p>After the eggs hatch, the larval ticks, which emerge from them, when they
succeed in finding a host, enter the ears and gradually develop to the stage at
which they are ready to leave the host animal. The females may live several
months, or even years, if they do not find mates. After mating they may deposit
their eggs intermittently. Hatching of the eggs may occur as early as 10 days
after deposition. The larvÃ¦ may live for 80 days without a host. The parasitic
period has been observed to vary from about two to about seven months.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;On account of their habits and great vitality and their
occurrence in various kinds of animals besides cattle, complete eradication is
a difficult problem. The only effective treatment known is to introduce
directly into the ear passages a remedy that will kill the ticks. Later, of
course, the cattle may become reinfested from exposure to infested ranges or
inclosures. The following mixture, however, in addition to killing the ticks in
the ears, will protect against reinfestation for about 30 days: Ordinary
commercial pine tar, two parts; cottonseed oil, one part&mdash;in each case by
volume. Animals to be treated are confined in a chute, and the mixture is
injected into the ears with a syringe, after the wax and other dÃ©bris in the
ears have been cleaned out with a wire probe that has an eyelet at one end.
Further information concerning ear ticks and the details of their treatment is
given in Farmers' Bulletin 980.</p>

</div>

<p style="width: 70%; margin-left: 0; float: left;">These worms are sometimes taken up by cattle when drinking from ponds. They
may attach themselves to the inner surface of the mouth or nose, and sometimes
reach the upper part of the windpipe or of the gullet. Bleeding at the mouth or
nose may be noticed, the membranes where the leech is attached are liable to be
swollen and congested, and as a result of the loss of blood a condition of
anemia may result.</p>

<p style="width: 70%; margin-left: 0; float: left;"><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;If the worm can be reached it may be destroyed by cutting
it in two with a pair of scissors, or it may be removed with forceps or with
the fingers after wrapping a towel around the hand so that the worm can be held
without slipping. Fumigation with tobacco or tar may cause the worm to release
its hold if it can not be removed by other means. Ponds may be rid of
infestation with bloodsuckers by the introduction of eels.</p>

worms (<em>H&aelig;monchus contortus</em>). Outlines showing natural size of male (above) and

</div>

<p style="width: 70%; float: right;">The stomach of cattle consists of four compartments, of which the first and
fourth are most likely to be the seat of parasitic infestation. The first
stomach, or paunch, contains large numbers of minute parasites known as
protozoa, which are too small to be seen with the naked eye. These small
organisms apparently are in no way injurious. A species of fluke
(<em>Paramphistomum cervi</em> or a closely related species) is occasionally found in
North American cattle, especially grass-fed cattle, attached to the inner
surface of the first stomach (fig. 12). This worm is about one-half inch long,
and somewhat conical in shape; hence the name, conical fluke, by which it is
sometimes known. Although this parasite has been accused of producing serious
effects, it is generally considered harmless.</p>

<p style="width: 70%; float: right;">Several species of roundworms may occur in the fourth stomach. Two of these
are of special importance.</p>

<h5>THE TWISTED STOMACH WORM (HÃMONCHUS CONTORTUS).</h5>

<p>The twisted stomach worm (<em>H&aelig;monchus contortus</em>, figs. 13, 14, 15) is
sometimes found in enormous numbers in the fourth stomach of cattle. Sheep,
goats, and other ruminants may also be infested with it. Among the symptoms
caused by this parasite may be mentioned anemia, loss of flesh, general
weakness, dullness, capricious appetite, excessive thirst, and diarrhea. The
anemic condition is seen in the paleness of the skin and mucous membranes of
the mouth <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
and eye, and in the watery swellings which often develop under the
lower jaw ("poverty jaw"). If the fourth stomach of a dead animal is cut open
and the contents carefully examined, the parasites, which are from &frac12; inch to
1&frac14; inches in length and about as thick as an ordinary pin, may be seen, if
present in any considerable number, actively wriggling about like little
snakes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 387px;">

worms (<em>H&aelig;monchus contortus</em>). Male (<em>a</em>), female (<em>b</em>),

</div>

<p>Cattle become infected with these parasites by grazing on pastures on which
infested cattle, sheep, or goats have grazed and scattered their droppings. The
worms in the stomach produce a multitude of eggs (fig. 14<em>c</em>) of microscopic
size, which pass out of the body in the feces. In warm weather these eggs hatch
in a few hours. If the temperature is below 40Â° F., they remain dormant, and if
below freezing, they soon die. The eggs are also killed by dryness; moisture,
on the other hand, favoring their development. The larvÃ¦ which hatch from the
eggs are microscopic in size, and, like the eggs, are, at first and until they
have developed to a certain stage, very susceptible to freezing and drying. In
very warm weather the larvÃ¦ complete their development, so far as they are able
to develop outside the body, in two or three days. In cooler weather the time
required for this development is longer, and at temperatures below 70Â° F. 10
days to several weeks may be necessary. The larvÃ¦ are then ready to be taken
into the body. The eggs and early stages of the larvÃ¦ apparently do not develop
if swallowed, and only the completed larval stage seems to be infectious. In
this stage the larvÃ¦ migrate up grass stalks (fig. 15) or other objects,
showing activity whenever <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">
[Pg 521]</a></span>the air is saturated with moisture; that is, during
rains, fogs, and dews. When the air becomes dry and the moisture evaporates
from the grass the young worms cease their activity, resuming their migrations
when the air again becomes overladen with moisture. LarvÃ¦ which have developed
to the infectious stage, unlike the eggs and early larval stages, are able to
survive long periods of freezing and dryness. In two weeks to a month after the
embryos are swallowed they reach maturity and begin producing eggs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px;">

</div>

<p><em>Preventive treatment</em>.&mdash;Preventive measures are important. As moisture
favors the development of the embryos, high sloping ground is preferable for
pastures. If low ground is used, it should be properly drained. The pasture
should not be overstocked. Burning over the pasture will destroy most of the
young worms on the grass and on the ground, and this means of disinfection
under certain circumstances may be very advantageously used. The herd should be
changed to fresh pasture as often as possible. Cattle should be supplied with
water from wells, springs, or flowing streams, preferably in tanks or troughs
raised above the ground. To a slight degree salt serves to protect cattle
against infection with internal parasites, and plenty of it should therefore be
kept accessible.</p>

<p>Affected animals should be isolated from the rest of the herd in hospital
pens or pastures. A plentiful supply of nourishing feed is an important factor
in enabling cattle to withstand the attacks of stomach worms and other
intestinal parasites. The stabling of cattle, with the maintenance of clean and
sanitary surroundings and liberal feeding, will often stop losses from internal
parasites, even though no medicinal treatment is given.</p>

<p><em>Medicinal treatment</em>.&mdash;In dosing animals for stomach worms it is
advisable to treat not only the animals which are seriously affected, but the
rest of the herd as well, since the parasites with which they are infested will
remain as a source of reinfection to the others. The cattle should be removed
to fresh pasture after treatment, if possible.</p>

<p>The animals to be treated should be deprived of feed for 12 to 16, or even
24, hours before they are dosed, and if the bluestone treatment is used should
receive no water on the day they are dosed until several hours after dosing. In
drenching, a long-necked bottle or a drenching tube may be used. In case the
former is used the dose <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">
[Pg 522]</a></span>to be given may be first measured off, poured into the
bottle, and the point marked on the outside with a file, so that subsequent
doses may be measured in the bottle itself. A simple form of drenching tube
(fig. 16) consists of a piece of rubber tubing about 3 feet long and one-half
inch in diameter, with an ordinary tin funnel inserted in one end and a piece
of brass or iron tubing 4 to 6 inches long, of suitable diameter, inserted in
the other end. In use the metal tube is placed in the animal's mouth between
the back teeth, and the dose is poured into the funnel, which is either held by
an assistant or fastened to a post. The flow of liquid through the tube is
controlled by pinching the rubber tubing near the point of union with the metal
tube. It is important not to raise the animal's head too high on account of the
danger of the dose entering the lungs. The nose should not be raised higher
than the level of the eyes. The animal may be dosed either standing on all
fours or lying on the side.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 640px;">

</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The position on all fours is preferred by some authorities, who believe that
more of the remedy is likely to reach the fourth stomach when the animal is
dosed standing than when dosed in other positions.</p>

<p>Great care should be used in dosing to prevent the entrance of the liquid
into the lungs, and in the preparation and administration of the remedy to
avoid getting the solution too strong or the dose too large.</p>

<p>Bluestone, or copper sulphate, has been extensively used in South Africa in
the treatment of sheep and cattle for stomach worms and is recommended by the
colonial veterinary surgeon of the Cape Colony as the best and safest remedy.
To prepare the solution take 1 pound (avoirdupois) of pure bluestone, powder it
fine, and dissolve in 9&frac12; gallons of warm water. It is better first to
dissolve the bluestone in 2 or 3 quarts of boiling water, then add the
remaining quantity of cold water, and mix thoroughly. This solution may be
given to cattle in the following-sized doses:</p>

<p>In making up the solution only clear blue crystals of bluestone should be
used. Bluestone with white patches or crusts should be <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>rejected. It is
especially important that the bluestone and water be accurately weighed and
measured, and that the size of the dose be graduated according to the age of
the animal.</p>

<p>The special value of medicated salts advertised under various trade names as
preventives against worms is problematical. Commonly they contain little else
than ordinary salt, the other substances being in such small quantity that
their therapeutic effect is practically negligible. Definite evidence that they
are more efficacious than plain salt is not yet available and their use is not
recommended.</p>

<p style="width: 65%; float: left;">This parasite is as thick as a fine hair and less than half an inch in
length. It lives in small cysts in the wall of the fourth stomach (fig. 17)
and is also found free in the cavity of the stomach. When numerous, these parasites
cause a thickening of the stomach wall and disturb its digestive functions. The
symptoms caused by this parasite are very similar to those produced by the
twisted stomach worm. The life history of the encysted stomach worm is not
known in detail, but it is undoubtedly very much the same as that of the
twisted stomach worm. The same measures as recommended above for preventing
infection with the twisted stomach worm should be used. Medicinal treatment
would seem to be of little use, owing to the protected position in which the
parasite occurs.</p>

</div>

<p style="width: 60%; float: right;">Two species of tapeworms (fig. 18) are known to occur in the small intestine
of American cattle. They sometimes grow to a length of several yards and to a
breadth of three-fourths of an inch. Small portions of tapeworms, consisting of
one or more segments, are occasionally seen in the droppings of infested
cattle. The life history is not known, but the infectious stage is undoubtedly
taken in with the feed or water, infection being spread by the eggs of the
parasite contained in the feces of infested animals. The eggs are perhaps
swallowed by some small creature (an insect, worm, or snail) which acts as an
intermediate host, and which when accidentally swallowed by a cow while grazing
or drinking carries with it into her stomach the infectious stage of the
tapeworm.</p>

unsatisfactory, but the bluestone treatment used for stomach worms and
mentioned above (<a href="#Page_522">p. 522</a>) sometimes expels tapeworms.
Arsenic in doses of 1&frac12; to 3 grains has been claimed to give good results in the
treatment of calves for tapeworms. From results obtained at the Oklahoma Experiment
Station in the treatment of tapeworms of sheep it would appear that the efficacy
of the bluestone treatment against these parasites may be increased by the addition
of tobacco. For use on cattle the bluestone and tobacco mixture may be prepared as
follows: 13 ounces of snuff or powdered tobacco is soaked over night in about 8
gallons of water. To this decoction is added 1 pound of copper sulphate which
has been dissolved in 2 or 3 quarts of boiling water. Sufficient water is then
added to the mixture to make a total of 9&frac12; gallons. The doses of this
solution are the same as for the simple copper sulphate solution, described on

<h5>ROUNDWORMS.</h5>

<p>A large roundworm (<em>Ascaris vitulorum</em>) measuring 6 to 12 inches in length,
sometimes found in the intestines of cattle, especially calves, may cause
inflammation and occasionally rupture of the intestine. Infection occurs
through the swallowing of the eggs of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525"
id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>parasite in feed or water which has
been contaminated with the feces of infested cattle.</p>

<p>A number of species of small roundworms, varying in size from an eighth of
an inch to an inch or more in length, occur in the intestines. Of these may be
mentioned the hookworm (<em>Bunostomum phlebotomum</em>) and the nodular worm
(<em>&OElig;sophagostomum radiatum</em>). The former is about an inch long and is found in
the small intestine. The latter is somewhat smaller and is found in the cecum
and large intestine. Hookworms, when numerous, may cause anemia and other
symptoms similar to those caused by stomach worms (see <a href="#Page_519">p. 519</a>). The injury to
the mucous lining of the intestine from the bites of hookworms may cause severe
inflammation, and affords an avenue of infection with the germs of various
diseases. The adult nodular worms apparently do not attack the wall of the
intestine, but derive their nourishment from the intestinal contents. Several
species of small, very slender roundworms (<em>Trichostrongylus</em>), less than a
quarter of an inch in length, sometimes occur in the small intestine and fourth
stomach, and a severe gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the stomach and
intestines, has been attributed to them. One species of small roundworm
(<em>Cooperia punctata</em>) burrows in the wall of the small intestine and causes
caseous nodules in the mucous lining. This parasite sometimes occurs in very
large numbers in the intestines of cattle in certain sections of the country,
and apparently does considerable damage.</p>

<p><em>Nodular disease</em> of the intestine, due to young nodular worms which burrow in
the intestinal wall during a certain stage in their life history, sometimes
apparently produces serious effects, particularly in young cattle, but commonly
has little or no perceptible influence on the general health. It, however,
often renders the intestine unfit for use as sausage casings, and as it is
widely prevalent among cattle the loss from this source is considerable. The
greenish or yellowish nodules with cheesy contents are frequently mistaken by
the inexperienced for lesions of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The life histories of the various small roundworms occurring in the
intestines of cattle, so far as they have been worked out, are very similar to
that of the twisted stomach worm as described on <a href="#Page_519">page 519</a>.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for intestinal roundworms</em>.&mdash;The preventive measures are
similar to those recommended in the case of the twisted stomach worm (<a href="#Page_521">p. 521</a>).
Medical treatment is generally not very satisfactory. According to the Oklahoma
Experiment Station, the addition of 1 per cent of tobacco to the bluestone
solution used in the treatment of stomach worms in sheep is effective in the
removal of hookworms. The bluestone and tobacco mixture described on <a href="#Page_524">page 524</a>
may be of value in the treatment of hookworms in cattle. It is asserted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
one author that 2 or 3 drams of rectified empyreumatic oil in a mucilaginous
emulsion, followed the next morning with a purgative of 1 to 1&frac12; pounds of
sulphate of soda, will expel the large roundworms (<em>Ascaris vitulorum</em>).</p>

<h4>PROTOZOA.</h4>

<p>A number of species of protozoa have been reported as parasites of the
intestines of cattle. To one species has been attributed a serious disease of
cattle in Switzerland known as red dysentery, but so far comparatively few
cases of this disease have been recorded in America. It is probably more common
than is generally supposed. Calves particularly seem most likely to be
affected.</p>

<h4>FLUKES IN LIVER AND LUNGS.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 242px;">
<a name="FIG_19" id="FIG_19"></a>
<img src="images/figure19.jpg" width="242" alt="FIG. 19" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 19.&mdash;The common liver
fluke (<em>Fasciola hepatica</em>).</span>
</div>

<p>Two species of flukes occurring in the liver and lungs are known to affect
cattle in the United States. These parasites are flat, leaf-like worms; one of
them, the common liver fluke (<em>Fasciola hepatica</em>, fig. 19), is less than an inch
in length, while the other, the large American fluke (<em>Fasciola magna</em>, fig. 20),
is considerably larger when full grown. In their life history these flukes
depend on snails as intermediate hosts. At a certain stage of development the
young flukes leave the snails, become encysted on stalks of grass (fig. 21), or
fall into drinking water, and finally may be swallowed by cattle. Stiles writes
as follows:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">
<a name="FIG_20" id="FIG_20"></a>
<img src="images/figure20.jpg" width="480" alt="FIG. 20" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 20.&mdash;The large American
fluke (<em>Fasciola magna</em>).</span>
</div>

<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Flukes may produce a serious, often fatal, disease, more especially in
younger animals. The symptoms are somewhat similar to those produced by worms
in the stomach. The first symptoms are generally overlooked, the disease not
attracting attention until the appetite is diminished; rumination becomes
irregular, the animals become hidebound, and the coat dull and staring. The
staring coat is due to the contraction of the muscles of the hair follicles.
The visible mucous membranes become pale, eyes become dull, there is running at
the eyes, and the animal gradually becomes emaciated. As the disease advances
the milk supply is lessened, fever appears, there is generally great thirst,
but the appetite almost ceases; edematous swellings appear on the belly,
breast, etc.; diarrhea at first alternates with constipation, but finally
becomes continuous. The disease lasts from two to five months, when the most
extreme cases succumb.</p>

<p>Most of the German cattle are said to be infested with liver flukes, but
even when a large number are present the nourishment of the cattle is not
disturbed. Thickening of the gall ducts, so that a so-called "Medusa's head"
forms on the surface of the liver toward the stomach, appears in even
well-nourished animals; even in cases of a cirrhosis of the liver it is seldom
that any effect upon the cattle's health can be noticed, and so long as a
portion of the liver tissue about twice the size of the fist remains intact,
the nourishment of the animal may be comparatively good. It is rare that one
sees a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
generalized edema in slaughtered cattle as a result of fluke invasion,
and even in the heaviest infections of young cattle only emaciation is
noticed.</p>

<p><em>Treatment</em>.&mdash;Medicinal treatment is unsatisfactory. The disease may be
prevented to a considerable extent by giving animals plenty of salt, and by
introducing carp, frogs, and toads into infected districts; these animals
destroy the young stages of the parasite and feed upon the snails which serve
as intermediate hosts.</p>

<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>

<p>The drainage of wet pastures and the avoidance of swampy lands for grazing
purposes are important measures in the prevention of fluke diseases.</p>

<p>Railliet and others have recently recommended the application of lime to
fluky pastures, having discovered that very weak solutions are destructive not
only to fluke embryos but to snails. This application is to be made during the
summer months at the rate of about 500 to 1,000 pounds of lime per acre. The
same authors also recommend extract of male fern for the treatment of fluke
disease. Moussu states that the average dose for cattle is 1 gram of the
extract for each 10 kilograms of live weight; that is, 10 grams for a young
animal weighing 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) up to 50 grams as a maximum
for large animals weighing 500 kilograms (about 1,100 pounds) or more. The
extract is mixed with about 5 times as much non-purgative oil and the dose is
administered each morning for five consecutive days two hours before the animal
is allowed to feed after having been fasted over night. The extract of male
fern used should have a guaranteed strength of 22 to 25 per cent of filicine
and 3.5 per cent of filicic acid.</p>

<h4>TAPEWORM CYSTS OF LIVER AND OTHER VISCERA.</h4>

<p>Three kinds of tapeworm cysts are found in the viscera of cattle. One of
these (<em>Multiceps multiceps</em>, or <em>C&oelig;nurus cerebralis</em>) will be further referred to
in the discussion of gid (<a href="#Page_528">p. 528</a>). All these are the intermediate stages of
tapeworms, which live when mature in the intestines of dogs, wolves, and other
canines. The eggs of the tapeworms are scattered over the fields in the
droppings of infested dogs or wolves, and when swallowed in food or water by
cattle hatch out <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
and the embryos migrate to the liver, mesentery, lungs, brain, or other organs,
where they develop into cysts, variously known as hydatids, bladder worms, water
balls, etc. When organs of cattle thus infested are eaten by dogs or wolves
the cystic worms are also liable to be swallowed and then develop into mature
tapeworms. To prevent cattle from infection with these parasites stray dogs,
wolves, and coyotes should be killed wherever found, and dogs too valuable to kill
should be kept free from tapeworms. As a precaution against infection with tapeworms,
the viscera of cattle, sheep, or hogs should not be fed to dogs unless cooked.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Hydatids</span> (<em>Echinococcus granulosus</em>) form tumors
(fig. 22) of varying size (sometimes as large as 6 inches in diameter) in the
liver, lungs, and other organs. Their contents are liquid, resembling water.
The presence of these parasites can not be detected in the living animal and
there is no medicinal treatment for them. Organs containing hydatids should be
destroyed by burning in order to prevent their being eaten by dogs. This is
especially important, as dogs infested with the tapeworm stage of this parasite
are a menace to human beings on account of the danger of infecting them with
hydatids, which develop in man if the eggs of the hydatid tapeworm are
swallowed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thin-necked bladder worms</span> (<em>T&aelig;nia hydatigena</em>, fig.
23) are most commonly found attached to the mesentery and omentum. There is no
medicinal treatment.</p>

"turnsick," or "staggers," deserve mention, as they are rather common among sheep
in the Northwest. As already alluded to, these worms are the intermediate stage
of a tapeworm found in dogs, and their life history and the means of preventing
infection have been briefly discussed above (see p. 527).</p>

<p>Cattle harboring this parasite show symptoms indicating an affection of the
brain, walking or turning in circles, dizziness, uneven gait, impaired vision,
etc.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in trephining the skull and removing the parasite, an
operation which requires a skillful operator and is frequently unsuccessful.
Unless the parasite is removed affected cattle almost invariably die.</p>

<h4>TAPEWORM CYSTS IN THE MUSCLES, BEEF MEASLES.<a name="FNanchor_19_19"
id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h4>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 23.&mdash;Thin-necked bladder
worm (<em>T&aelig;nia hydatigena</em>) from abdominal cavity of a steer.</span>
</div>

<p>Small tapeworm cysts (<em>T&aelig;nia saginat&aelig;</em>), about the size of a pea, found in the
muscles of cattle are the larv&aelig; of the common tapeworm of man. Cattle become
infected from feed or water which has been contaminated by the feces of persons
harboring the adult tapeworms, and human beings in turn become infected by
eating raw or rare beef infested with the larval stage (measly beef).</p>

<p>To prevent cattle from becoming infested with this parasite care should be
taken that human feces are not placed where they will contaminate the feed or
drinking water.</p>

<p>This parasite is very common in cattle in the United States, at least 1 per
cent being infested. As a result considerable loss is entailed through
condemnations of beef carcasses by meat inspectors, because of the presence of
tapeworm cysts. All this loss could be avoided and the danger of tapeworm
infestation in human beings from this source could be removed by the observance
of proper precautions in disposing of human excreta. At the same time much
sickness and many deaths from diseases (hookworm, typhoid fever, etc.) caused
by soil pollution would be prevented, and farm life would be rendered much
safer than under the poor sanitary conditions which are responsible for the
high percentage of tapeworm cysts among cattle in the United States.</p>

<h4>THREAD WORMS IN THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY.</h4>

<p>Thread worms (<em>Setaria labiato-papillosa</em>) 2 to 4 inches long are frequently
found in the abdominal cavity. They seem to cause little or no trouble. The
embryos produced by these worms enter the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530"
id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>blood vessels. According to NoÃ©, they are spread from
one animal to another by stable flies (see <a href="#Page_503">p. 503</a>), but
this has not been definitely proved. The roundworms found occasionally in the
anterior chamber of the eye (see <a href="#Page_531">p. 531</a>) are perhaps
immature forms of this species which have reached this location during their
migration.</p>

<h4>LUNG WORMS.</h4>

<p>Lung worms (<em>Dictyocaulus viviparus</em>, fig. 24) in cattle are thread-like worms
2 to 4 inches long, found in the bronchial tubes and producing a condition
known as verminous bronchitis. The life history of the parasite is not fully
known, but infection is evidently derived through the medium of pastures where
infested cattle have grazed. In the later stages of the disease the cattle
cough, especially at night. Young cattle are more seriously affected than old
animals.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for lung worms</em>.&mdash;Various treatments have been advocated</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">

</div>
<p>for lung worms, including fumigating with different substances and injections of
remedies into the trachea by means of a large hypodermic syringe or by a
special spraying apparatus, but none have been very successful from a practical
standpoint. About all that can be done is to feed affected animals well and
protect them from exposure, removing them from the pasture and keeping them in
dry yards or stables maintained in a cleanly, sanitary condition.</p>

<p>The methods of prevention in general are similar to those described under
the discussion of the twisted stomach worm (<a href="#Page_521">p. 521</a>).</p>

<h4>PARASITES OF THE BLOOD.</h4>

<p>Certain flukes (<em>Schistosoma bovis</em> and related species) which live in the
blood vessels (the large veins) of cattle in tropical and sub-tropical
countries cause bloody urine and diarrhea, the feces being mixed with blood.
These parasites have not yet been discovered in the United States, although the
natural conditions are such in some parts of the country that they are liable
to become established if introduced.</p>

<p>The embryos of <em>Setaria labiato-papillosa</em> (<a href="#Page_529">p. 529</a>)
which occur in the blood may be found by microscopical examination. They apparently
cause no trouble.</p>

<p>The organism which causes Texas fever is a protozoan parasite (<em>Piroplasma
bigeminum</em>) of microscopic size, which lives in the blood <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>and attacks the red
blood corpuscles. For a discussion of this parasite and the disease which it
produces see <a href="#Page_476">page 476</a> of this volume.</p>

<p>Other parasites which live in the blood cause serious diseases known as
surra and nagana (<a href="#Page_500">p. 500</a>), but as yet neither of these diseases has gained a
foothold in the United States.</p>

<h4>PARASITES OF THE EYE.</h4>

<p>Small roundworms, one-third to four-fifths of an inch in length, may occur
in the ducts of the lacrimal glands. Several species all belonging to the same
genus (<em>Thelazia</em>) are known. They sometimes escape from their usual location and
may be found on the surface of the eyeball beneath the lids, or even in the
eyeball. It has been supposed by some writers that the worms seen in the
interior of the eyeball ("snakes in the eye") are immature stages of <em>Setaria
labiato-papillosa</em> (see <a href="#Page_529">p. 529</a>) which have gone astray from the normal course of
their migration, but the correctness of this supposition is uncertain.</p>

<p>Worms in the eyes and lacrimal ducts may cause inflammation, in which case
the eyes may be syringed with an antiseptic, such as a weak solution of
coal-tar stock dip, and iodoform ointment applied if the condition is
severe.</p>

<p>When worms are present in the eyeball itself, their removal depends upon
surgical treatment, usually not advisable, as the worms in that location either
cause but little trouble or disappear without treatment.</p>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">John R. Mohler, V. M. D.</span>,</h3>

<h5><em>Chief, Bureau of Animal Industry</em>.</h5>

<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>Numerous letters have been received by this bureau in recent years relative
to the existence of a disease affecting the mouths and feet of cattle in
certain Eastern and Central Western States. Later reports indicate that the
malady has made its appearance in the Southwest, where it has caused much alarm
among the stockmen owing to its similarity to the foot-and-mouth disease of
Europe. The disease, which is to be discussed under the name of mycotic
stomatitis, has been carefully investigated by this department on various
occasions, and it is with the view of giving the results of these clinical
investigations as well as to assert its noninfectiousness and to differentiate
it from the virulent foot-and-mouth disease, which it so closely simulates,
that this article is prepared.</p>

<h4>NAME AND SYNONYMS.</h4>

<p>The name stomatitis signifies that there is present in the affected animals
an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. This inflammation, which
quickly develops into ulcers, is one of the principal and most frequently
observed lesions. Mycotic stomatitis refers to that form of stomatitis which
results from eating food containing irritant fungi. Thus the name not only
suggests the cause of the disease, but also indicates the location of the
earliest and most prominent symptoms. Other names which have been applied to
this disease by different writers are sporadic aphthÃ¦; aphthous stomatitis;
sore mouth of cattle; sore tongue; benign, simple, or noninfectious
foot-and-mouth disease; mycotic aphthous stomatitis; and sporadic stomatitis
aphthosa.</p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF THE DISEASE.</h4>

<p>Mycotic stomatitis is a sporadic, or noninfectious, disease which affects
cattle of all ages that are on pasture, but more especially milch cows. It is
characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane of the
mouth, producing salivation and inappetence, and secondarily affecting the
feet, which become sore and swollen. Superficial erosions of the skin,
particularly of the muzzle <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">
[Pg 533]</a></span>and of the teats and udders of cows, may also be
present, with some elevation of temperature and emaciation.</p>

<h4>CAUSE.</h4>

<p>This disease, as its name indicates, results from the eating of forage
containing fungi or molds. It is probable that more than one fungus is involved
in the production of this disease, but no particular species has been
definitely proved to be the causative factor. Several attempts have been made
by the writer to determine the exact cause and also to transmit the disease to
other animals by direct inoculation, but with negative results. Suspicion,
however, has been directed by various observers to the Uromyces and the red and
black rusts that occur on clovers. These fungi cause very severe irritation of
the lining membrane of the mouth, producing sometimes a catarrhal, at other
times an aphthous, and occasionally an ulcerous stomatitis. The fungus of rape,
etc. (<em>Polydesmus excitiosus</em>), is very irritating to the mouths and feet of
cattle, causing severe inflammation and in some instances producing symptoms
that have been mistaken for foot-and-mouth disease. The fungi (Penicillium and
Puccinia) found on grasses have also been credited with the production of
stomatitis. The fact that this disease disappears from a locality at a certain
time and reappears at irregular intervals would suggest the probability that
certain climatic conditions were essential for the propagation of the causative
fungi, since it is well known that the malady becomes prevalent after a hot,
dry period has been followed by rain, thus furnishing the requirements
necessary for the luxuriant development of molds and fungi. Owing to this fact
the disease is observed in one locality during one season and in an entirely
different section another year, but reappears in the former center when
favorable conditions prevail. In this way the affection has occurred at
irregular intervals in certain sections of both the United States and
Canada.</p>

<h4>SYMPTOMS AND LESIONS.</h4>

<p>Among the first symptoms observed in mycotic stomatitis are inability to
eat, suspension of rumination, frequent movements of the lips with the
formation of froth on their margins, and in some cases a dribbling of saliva
from the mouth. There is a desire to eat, and frequent attempts to take food
are made, but prehension is very difficult. If, however, feed is placed on the
back of the tongue, it is readily masticated and swallowed. If the mouth is
examined at this time, it will be found red and hot, and exceptionally small
blisters will be seen, which, however, quickly become eroded and develop into
active ulcers varying in size from one-eighth to 1 inch in diameter. Where
several ulcers have coalesced a large and irregularly indented <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>patch is formed. These
erosions are most frequently found on the gums around the incisor teeth,
on the dental pad, inside the lips, and on the tip of the tongue, but they also
occur on the cheeks, interdental space, and dorsum of the tongue. The ulcers
have a hemorrhagic border, a depressed suppurating surface, and contain a
brownish or yellowish colored dÃ©bris, which is soon replaced by granulation
tissue. As a result of this sloughing of the tissues and the retention of food
in the mouth, a very offensive odor is exhaled. The muzzle becomes dry and
parched in appearance, which condition is shortly followed by erosions and
exfoliations of the superficial layer of the skin. Adherent brownish crusts and
scabs form over the parts, and similar lesions are seen around the nostrils and
external surface of the lips.</p>

<p>In some cases there are associated with these alterations a slight swelling
and painfulness in the region of the pasterns, at times affecting the forefeet,
at other times the hind feet, and occasionally all four feet. In a few cases
the swelling may extend above the fetlock, but it has never been observed above
the knee or hock. The skin around the coronet may occasionally become fissured
and the thin skin in the cleft of the foot eroded and suppurated, but without
the formation of vesicles. As a result of these feet lesions, the affected
animal may assume a position with its back arched and the limbs propped under
the body as in a case of founder, and will manifest much pain and lameness in
walking. If it lies down, the animal shows reluctance in getting up, and
although manifesting no inclination to move about, when forced to do so there
is more or less stiffness and a tendency to kick or shake the foot as if to
dislodge a foreign body from between the claws.</p>

<p>In some outbreaks the milch cows have slight superficial erosions on the
teats which at times extend to the udder. The cracks in the skin are filled
with serum and form brownish-colored scabs. The teats become tender and the
milk secretion diminishes; in some cases it disappears. A similar tendency
toward the formation of fissures and scabs on the skin of the neck and
shoulders has manifested itself in a recent outbreak in Texas, and this feature
was likewise noticeable in the disease when it occurred in Maryland and
Virginia in 1889.</p>

<p>In mild cases only the mouth lesions may be observed, or these alterations
may be associated with one or more of the other above-described symptoms, but
in severe cases, where there is a generalized mycotic intoxication, one animal
may show all these alterations. When the disease is well developed the general
appearance of the animal is one of great lassitude, and it either stands off by
itself with hind feet drawn under the body and its forefeet extended, or it
assumes a recumbent position. Owing to the inability to eat and to <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>the general systemic
disturbance present, the animal loses flesh very rapidly and becomes greatly
emaciated in the latter stages of the disease. The temperature and pulse are
somewhat increased, the former 2 or 3 degrees, the latter to from 75 to 90
beats per minute. The fever is not lasting, and these symptoms are soon modified.
The animal has an anxious look, and in a few cases there is a gastrointestinal
irritation, the feces being thin, of a dark color, and of an offensive odor.</p>

<h4>PROGNOSIS AND MORTALITY.</h4>

<p>Mycotic stomatitis is not a serious disease, and in uncomplicated cases
recoveries soon follow the removal of the cause and the application of the
indicated remedies. In such cases complete restoration may take place within
one week. In mild outbreaks a large percentage of the animals will recover
without treatment, but that the disease is fatal is shown by the fact that
animals which develop an aggravated form of the affection succumb if not
treated. In such animals death occurs in 6 or 8 days, but the mortality in the
serious outbreaks thus far investigated has been less than 0.5 per cent. The
course of this disease is irregular and runs from 7 to 15 days, the average
case covering a period of about 10 days.</p>

<h4>DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.</h4>

<h5>FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.</h5>

<p>In examining a case of mycotic stomatitis it is important not to mistake it
for foot-and-mouth disease, which has appeared in this country on six occasions
only. This may be easily accomplished by taking into consideration the fact
that in the contagious foot-and-mouth disease there is a rapid infection of the
entire herd, as well as of any hogs and sheep that may be on the premises. It
is also readily transmitted to neighboring herds by the spread of the infection
from diseased animals, but it never occurs spontaneously. The characteristic
lesion of foot-and-mouth disease is the appearance of vesicles containing
serous fluid in the mouth and upon the udder, teats, heels, and coronary bands
of the affected animals. Drooling is profuse, and there is a peculiar smacking
sound made by sucking the affected lips.</p>

<p>Mycotic stomatitis occurs sporadically on widely separated farms, affecting
only a few animals in each herd, and the lesions produced consist of erosions
without the typical vesicular formations of foot-and-mouth disease. The failure
of the vesicles, if any appear, to spread extensively in the mouth, the absence
of these blisters on other portions of the body&mdash; notably the teats and
udder, and characteristically the feet&mdash;together with the absence of
infection in the herd, and the inability to transmit the disease to calves by
inocula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
tion, distinguish between this affection and foot-and-mouth disease. The
erosions of the mouth are not so extensive and they heal more rapidly in
mycotic stomatitis. The swelling of the feet and stiffness of the animal are
also more marked in mycotic stomatitis.</p>

<h5>ERGOTISM.</h5>

<p>The lesions resulting from ergotism may be differentiated from those of
mycotic stomatitis by the lack of ulcerative eruptions in the mouth and by the
location of the lesions at the tips of the ears, end of the tail, or upon the
lower part of the legs, usually below the knees or hocks. The lesions of
ergotism do not take the form of ulcers or festers, but the end of the limb
affected is diseased "in toto" and the eruption extends entirely around the
limbs, followed soon afterwards by a distinct line of demarcation between the
healthy skin above and the diseased below. The absence of suppurating sores
between the claws and on the mucous membrane of the mouth, the knowledge that
the lesion upon the limb in question extends uninterruptedly around it, and the
presence of ergotized seeds in the hay or grain fed the animals should point
conclusively to a diagnosis of ergotism.</p>

<h5>FOUL FOOT.</h5>

<p>In foul foot, or ground itch, of cattle, the inflammation of the skin and
toes usually affects but one foot. It begins as a superficial inflammation
followed by sloughing, ulceration, and the formation of fistulous tracts which
may involve the tendons, bones, and joints. The mouth remains unaffected, and
the presence of the disease may be traced to filth and poor drainage.</p>

<h5>NECROTIC STOMATITIS.</h5>

<p>In necrotic stomatitis (calf diphtheria) there is a formation of yellowish
cheesy patches in the mouth without any lesions of the feet or udder. It
affects sucking calves chiefly, and is caused by the <em>Bacillus necrophorus</em>.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT.</h4>

<p>The treatment of mycotic stomatitis should consist in first removing the
herd of cattle from the pasture in which they have been running. The affected
animals should, if it is possible, be brought to the barn or corral and fed on
soft, nutritious food, such as bran mashes, ground feed, and gruels. A bucket
of clear, cool water should be kept constantly in the manger, so that the
animal may drink or rinse the mouth at its pleasure; and it will be found
beneficial to dissolve 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of borax or 1 tablespoonful of
potassium chlorate in each of the first two buckets of water <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>taken during the
day. If the animals are gentle enough to be handled, the mouth should be
swabbed out daily with antiseptic washes, such as a 2 per cent solution of
carbolic acid or a 1 per cent solution of compound solution of cresol or of
permanganate of potassium, or 1 part of hydrogen peroxid to 2 parts of water.
This should be followed by astringents, such as one-half tablespoonful of alum,
borax, or chlorate of potassium placed on the tongue. Probably a more
satisfactory method of administering the antiseptic treatment to a large number
of animals would be to mix thoroughly 2 teaspoonfuls of pure carbolic acid
every morning in a quart of bran mash and give to each affected animal for a
period of five days. Range cattle may be more readily treated by the use of
medicated salt placed in troughs accessible to the animals. This salt may be
prepared by pouring 4 ounces of crude carbolic acid upon 12 quarts of ordinary
barrel salt, after which they are thoroughly mixed. The lesions of the feet
should be treated with a 2 per cent solution of carbolic acid, while the
fissures and other lesions of the skin will be benefited by the application of
carbolized vaseline or zinc ointment. If the animals are treated in this manner
and carefully fed, the disease will rapidly disappear.</p>
